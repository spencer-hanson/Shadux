=head1 NAME

gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

gcc [B<-c>|B<-S>|B<-E>] [B<-std=>I<standard>]
    [B<-g>] [B<-pg>] [B<-O>I<level>]
    [B<-W>I<warn>...] [B<-pedantic>]
    [B<-I>I<dir>...] [B<-L>I<dir>...]
    [B<-D>I<macro>[=I<defn>]...] [B<-U>I<macro>]
    [B<-f>I<option>...] [B<-m>I<machine-option>...]
    [B<-o> I<outfile>] [@I<file>] I<infile>...

Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  B<g++> accepts mostly the same options as B<gcc>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the B<-c> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.

Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.



The B<gcc> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may I<not> be grouped: B<-dv> is very different from S<B<-d
-v>>.

You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify B<-L> more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the B<-l> option is significant.

Many options have long names starting with B<-f> or with
B<-W>---for example,
B<-fmove-loop-invariants>, B<-Wformat> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
B<-ffoo> would be B<-fno-foo>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

=head2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output


Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:


=over 4


=item I<file>B<.c>

C source code which must be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.i>

C source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.ii>

C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.m>

Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the F<libobjc>
library to make an Objective-C program work.


=item I<file>B<.mi>

Objective-C source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.mm>


=item I<file>B<.M>

Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the F<libobjc>
library to make an Objective-C++ program work.  Note that B<.M> refers
to a literal capital M.


=item I<file>B<.mii>

Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.h>

C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a
precompiled header (default), or C, C++ header file to be turned into an
Ada spec (via the B<-fdump-ada-spec> switch).


=item I<file>B<.cc>


=item I<file>B<.cp>


=item I<file>B<.cxx>


=item I<file>B<.cpp>


=item I<file>B<.CPP>


=item I<file>B<.c++>


=item I<file>B<.C>

C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in B<.cxx>,
the last two letters must both be literally B<x>.  Likewise,
B<.C> refers to a literal capital C.


=item I<file>B<.mm>


=item I<file>B<.M>

Objective-C++ source code which must be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.mii>

Objective-C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.hh>


=item I<file>B<.H>


=item I<file>B<.hp>


=item I<file>B<.hxx>


=item I<file>B<.hpp>


=item I<file>B<.HPP>


=item I<file>B<.h++>


=item I<file>B<.tcc>

C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header or Ada spec.


=item I<file>B<.f>


=item I<file>B<.for>


=item I<file>B<.ftn>

Fixed form Fortran source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.F>


=item I<file>B<.FOR>


=item I<file>B<.fpp>


=item I<file>B<.FPP>


=item I<file>B<.FTN>

Fixed form Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with the traditional
preprocessor).


=item I<file>B<.f90>


=item I<file>B<.f95>


=item I<file>B<.f03>


=item I<file>B<.f08>

Free form Fortran source code which should not be preprocessed.


=item I<file>B<.F90>


=item I<file>B<.F95>


=item I<file>B<.F03>


=item I<file>B<.F08>

Free form Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with the
traditional preprocessor).


=item I<file>B<.go>

Go source code.



=item I<file>B<.ads>

Ada source code file which contains a library unit declaration (a
declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a generic
instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a package,
generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also
called I<specs>.


=item I<file>B<.adb>

Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram or
package body).  Such files are also called I<bodies>.



=item I<file>B<.s>

Assembler code.


=item I<file>B<.S>


=item I<file>B<.sx>

Assembler code which must be preprocessed.


=item I<other>

An object file to be fed straight into linking.
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.

=back


You can specify the input language explicitly with the B<-x> option:


=over 4


=item B<-x> I<language>

Specify explicitly the I<language> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next B<-x> option.  Possible values for I<language> are:
	
	c  c-header  cpp-output
	c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
	objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
	objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output

=item B<-x none>

Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if B<-x>
has not been used at all).


=item B<-pass-exit-codes>

Normally the B<gcc> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
B<-pass-exit-codes>, the B<gcc> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran frontends return 4, if an internal
compiler error is encountered.

=back


If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
B<-x> (or filename suffixes) to tell B<gcc> where to start, and
one of the options B<-c>, B<-S>, or B<-E> to say where
B<gcc> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
B<-x cpp-output -E>) instruct B<gcc> to do nothing at all.


=over 4


=item B<-c>

Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix B<.c>, B<.i>, B<.s>, etc., with B<.o>.

Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.


=item B<-S>

Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix B<.c>, B<.i>, etc., with B<.s>.

Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.


=item B<-E>

Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.


=item B<-o> I<file>

Place output in file I<file>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

If B<-o> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in F<a.out>, the object file for
F<I<source>.I<suffix>> in F<I<source>.o>, its
assembler file in F<I<source>.s>, a precompiled header file in
F<I<source>.I<suffix>.gch>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.


=item B<-v>

Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.


=item B<-###>

Like B<-v> except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or C<./-_>.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.


=item B<-pipe>

Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.


=item B<--help>

Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by B<gcc>.  If the B<-v> option is also specified
then B<--help> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by B<gcc>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the B<-Wextra> option has also been specified
(prior to the B<--help> option), then command line options which
have no documentation associated with them will also be displayed.


=item B<--target-help>

Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command
line options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.


=item B<--help={>I<class>|[B<^>]I<qualifier>B<}>[B<,...>]

Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:


=over 4


=item B<optimizers>

This will display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.


=item B<warnings>

This will display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.


=item B<target>

This will display target-specific options.  Unlike the
B<--target-help> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler will not be displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended B<--help=> syntax.


=item B<params>

This will display the values recognized by the B<--param>
option.


=item I<language>

This will display the options supported for I<language>, where
I<language> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.


=item B<common>

This will display the options that are common to all languages.

=back


These are the supported qualifiers:


=over 4


=item B<undocumented>

Display only those options which are undocumented.


=item B<joined>

Display options which take an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
B<--help=target>.


=item B<separate>

Display options which take an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: B<-o output-file>.

=back


Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler the following can be used:

	
	--help=target,undocumented


The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
B<^> character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument), which have a description the following can be used:

	
	--help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented


The argument to B<--help=> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.

Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output by so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work however is when one of the classes is
I<target>.  So for example to display all the target-specific
optimization options the following can be used:

	
	--help=target,optimizers


The B<--help=> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use will display its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.

If the B<-Q> option appears on the command line before the
B<--help=> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
B<--help=> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the B<--help=> option is used).

Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of B<gcc>:

	
	  % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
	  The following options are target specific:
	  -mabi=                                2
	  -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
	  -mapcs                                [disabled]


The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at B<-O2> by using:

	
	-Q -O2 --help=optimizers


Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by B<-O3> by using:

	
	gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O3-opts
	gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O2-opts
	diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled



=item B<-no-canonical-prefixes>

Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to B</../>
or B</./>, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.


=item B<--version>

Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.


=item B<-wrapper>

Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
list.

	
	gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args


This will invoke all subprograms of B<gcc> under
B<gdb --args>, thus the invocation of B<cc1> will be
B<gdb --args cc1 ...>.


=item B<-fplugin=>I<name>B<.so>

Load the plugin code in file I<name>.so, assumed to be a
shared object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of
the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
purposes of argument parsing (See
B<-fplugin-arg->I<name>B<->I<key>B<=>I<value> below).
Each plugin should define the callback functions specified in the
Plugins API.


=item B<-fplugin-arg->I<name>B<->I<key>B<=>I<value>

Define an argument called I<key> with a value of I<value>
for the plugin called I<name>.


=item B<-fdump-ada-spec>[B<-slim>]

For C and C++ source and include files, generate corresponding Ada
specs. 


=item B<-fdump-go-spec=>I<file>

For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in I<file>.  This generates Go C<const>,
C<type>, C<var>, and C<func> declarations which may be a
useful way to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.



=item B<@>I<file>

Read command-line options from I<file>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @I<file> option.  If I<file>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.  

Options in I<file> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The I<file> may itself contain additional
@I<file> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

=back



=head2 Compiling C++ Programs


C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes B<.C>,
B<.cc>, B<.cpp>, B<.CPP>, B<.c++>, B<.cp>, or
B<.cxx>; C++ header files often use B<.hh>, B<.hpp>,
B<.H>, or (for shared template code) B<.tcc>; and
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix B<.ii>.  GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name B<gcc>).

However, the use of B<gcc> does not add the C++ library.
B<g++> is a program that calls GCC and treats B<.c>,
B<.h> and B<.i> files as C++ source files instead of C source
files unless B<-x> is used, and automatically specifies linking
against the C++ library.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a B<.h> extension for use in C++
compilations.  On many systems, B<g++> is also installed with
the name B<c++>.

When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.




=head2 Options Controlling C Dialect


The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:


=over 4


=item B<-ansi>

In C mode, this is equivalent to B<-std=c90>. In C++ mode, it is
equivalent to B<-std=c++98>.

This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the C<asm> and C<typeof> keywords, and
predefined macros such as C<unix> and C<vax> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style B<//> comments as well as
the C<inline> keyword.

The alternate keywords C<__asm__>, C<__extension__>,
C<__inline__> and C<__typeof__> continue to work despite
B<-ansi>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with B<-ansi>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as C<__unix__> and C<__vax__> are also available, with or
without B<-ansi>.

The B<-ansi> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, B<-pedantic> is required in
addition to B<-ansi>.  

The macro C<__STRICT_ANSI__> is predefined when the B<-ansi>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

Functions that would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as C<alloca> and C<ffs>) are not built-in
functions when B<-ansi> is used.  


=item B<-std=>

Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.

The compiler can accept several base standards, such as B<c90> or
B<c++98>, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
B<gnu90> or B<gnu++98>.  By specifying a base standard, the
compiler will accept all programs following that standard and those
using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
B<-std=c90> turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the C<asm> and C<typeof>
keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in
ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a C<?:>
expression. On the other hand, by specifying a GNU dialect of a
standard, all features the compiler support are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard and some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by B<-pedantic> to identify which features are GNU
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
B<-std=gnu90 -pedantic> would warn about C++ style B<//>
comments, while B<-std=gnu99 -pedantic> would not.

A value for this option must be provided; possible values are


=over 4


=item B<c90>


=item B<c89>


=item B<iso9899:1990>

Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that conflict
with ISO C90 are disabled). Same as B<-ansi> for C code.


=item B<iso9899:199409>

ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.


=item B<c99>


=item B<c9x>


=item B<iso9899:1999>


=item B<iso9899:199x>

ISO C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported; see
S<E<lt>B<http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/c99status.html>>E<gt> for more information.  The
names B<c9x> and B<iso9899:199x> are deprecated.


=item B<c1x>

ISO C1X, the draft of the next revision of the ISO C standard.
Support is limited and experimental and features enabled by this
option may be changed or removed if changed in or removed from the
standard draft.


=item B<gnu90>


=item B<gnu89>

GNU dialect of ISO C90 (including some C99 features). This
is the default for C code.


=item B<gnu99>


=item B<gnu9x>

GNU dialect of ISO C99.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC,
this will become the default.  The name B<gnu9x> is deprecated.


=item B<gnu1x>

GNU dialect of ISO C1X.  Support is limited and experimental and
features enabled by this option may be changed or removed if changed
in or removed from the standard draft.


=item B<c++98>

The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Same as B<-ansi> for
C++ code.


=item B<gnu++98>

GNU dialect of B<-std=c++98>.  This is the default for
C++ code.


=item B<c++0x>

The working draft of the upcoming ISO C++0x standard. This option
enables experimental features that are likely to be included in
C++0x. The working draft is constantly changing, and any feature that is
enabled by this flag may be removed from future versions of GCC if it is
not part of the C++0x standard.


=item B<gnu++0x>

GNU dialect of B<-std=c++0x>. This option enables
experimental features that may be removed in future versions of GCC.

=back



=item B<-fgnu89-inline>

The option B<-fgnu89-inline> tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for C<inline> functions when in C99 mode.
  This option
is accepted and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including
4.3.  In GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC in
C99 mode.  Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
C<gnu_inline> function attribute to all inline functions.

The option B<-fno-gnu89-inline> explicitly tells GCC to use the
C99 semantics for C<inline> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior).  This option was first supported in
GCC 4.3.  This option is not supported in B<-std=c90> or
B<-std=gnu90> mode.

The preprocessor macros C<__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__> and
C<__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__> may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for C<inline> functions.  


=item B<-aux-info> I<filename>

Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.

Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (B<I>, B<N> for new or
B<O> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (B<C> or B<F>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.


=item B<-fno-asm>

Do not recognize C<asm>, C<inline> or C<typeof> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords C<__asm__>, C<__inline__> and C<__typeof__>
instead.  B<-ansi> implies B<-fno-asm>.

In C++, this switch only affects the C<typeof> keyword, since
C<asm> and C<inline> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the B<-fno-gnu-keywords> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (B<-std=c99> or B<-std=gnu99>), this
switch only affects the C<asm> and C<typeof> keywords, since
C<inline> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.


=item B<-fno-builtin>


=item B<-fno-builtin->I<function>

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
B<__builtin_> as prefix.  

GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to C<alloca> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to C<memcpy>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with B<-Wformat> for bad calls to
C<printf>, when C<printf> is built in, and C<strlen> is
known not to modify global memory.

With the B<-fno-builtin->I<function> option
only the built-in function I<function> is
disabled.  I<function> must not begin with B<__builtin_>.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
B<-fbuiltin->I<function> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using B<-fno-builtin> or
B<-ffreestanding>, you may define macros such as:

	
	#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
	#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))



=item B<-fhosted>


Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
B<-fbuiltin>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which C<main> has a return
type of C<int>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to B<-fno-freestanding>.


=item B<-ffreestanding>


Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies B<-fno-builtin>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at C<main>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel.
This is equivalent to B<-fno-hosted>.




=item B<-fopenmp>

Enable handling of OpenMP directives C<#pragma omp> in C/C++ and
C<!$omp> in Fortran.  When B<-fopenmp> is specified, the
compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v3.0 S<E<lt>B<http://www.openmp.org/>>E<gt>.  This option
implies B<-pthread>, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for B<-pthread>.


=item B<-fms-extensions>

Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar
to previous types declarations.

	
	typedef int UOW;
	struct ABC {
	  UOW UOW;
	};


Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.  


=item B<-fplan9-extensions>

Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.

This enables B<-fms-extensions>, permits passing pointers to
structures with anonymous fields to functions which expect pointers to
elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous
fields declared using a typedef.    This is only
supported for C, not C++.


=item B<-trigraphs>

Support ISO C trigraphs.  The B<-ansi> option (and B<-std>
options for strict ISO C conformance) implies B<-trigraphs>.


=item B<-no-integrated-cpp>

Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj" via the
B<-B> option.  The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling.  The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)

The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and
"cc1obj" are merged.


=item B<-traditional>


=item B<-traditional-cpp>

Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the B<-E> switch.
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the GNU
CPP manual for details.


=item B<-fcond-mismatch>

Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.


=item B<-flax-vector-conversions>

Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.


=item B<-funsigned-char>

Let the type C<char> be unsigned, like C<unsigned char>.

Each kind of machine has a default for what C<char> should
be.  It is either like C<unsigned char> by default or like
C<signed char> by default.

Ideally, a portable program should always use C<signed char> or
C<unsigned char> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain C<char> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

The type C<char> is always a distinct type from each of
C<signed char> or C<unsigned char>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.


=item B<-fsigned-char>

Let the type C<char> be signed, like C<signed char>.

Note that this is equivalent to B<-fno-unsigned-char>, which is
the negative form of B<-funsigned-char>.  Likewise, the option
B<-fno-signed-char> is equivalent to B<-funsigned-char>.


=item B<-fsigned-bitfields>


=item B<-funsigned-bitfields>


=item B<-fno-signed-bitfields>


=item B<-fno-unsigned-bitfields>

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either C<signed> or C<unsigned>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as C<int> are signed types.

=back



=head2 Options Controlling C++ Dialect


This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file C<firstClass.C> like this:

	
	g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C


In this example, only B<-frepo> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

Here is a list of options that are I<only> for compiling C++ programs:


=over 4



=item B<-fabi-version=>I<n>

Use version I<n> of the C++ ABI.  Version 2 is the version of the
C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI specification.
Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change as ABI bugs
are fixed.

The default is version 2.

Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.

Version 4 implements a standard mangling for vector types.

Version 5 corrects the mangling of attribute const/volatile on
function pointer types, decltype of a plain decl, and use of a
function parameter in the declaration of another parameter.

See also B<-Wabi>.


=item B<-fno-access-control>

Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.


=item B<-fcheck-new>

Check that the pointer returned by C<operator new> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
C<operator new> will only return C<0> if it is declared
B<throw()>, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
C<operator new> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing C<std::bad_alloc>.  See also
B<new (nothrow)>.


=item B<-fconserve-space>

Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after C<main()> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.

This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into BSS without making them common.


=item B<-fconstexpr-depth=>I<n>

Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++0x constexpr functions
to I<n>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.


=item B<-fno-deduce-init-list>

Disable deduction of a template type parameter as
std::initializer_list from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.

	
	template <class T> auto forward(T t) -> decltype (realfn (t))
	{
	  return realfn (t);
	}
	
	void f()
	{
	  forward({1,2}); // call forward<std::initializer_list<int>>
	}


This option is present because this deduction is an extension to the
current specification in the C++0x working draft, and there was
some concern about potential overload resolution problems.


=item B<-ffriend-injection>

Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in ISO C++ a friend function which is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.

This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.


=item B<-fno-elide-constructors>

The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.


=item B<-fno-enforce-eh-specs>

Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at runtime.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
B<NDEBUG>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
will still optimize based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception will result in undefined behavior.


=item B<-ffor-scope>


=item B<-fno-for-scope>

If B<-ffor-scope> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a I<for-init-statement> is limited to the B<for> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard.
If B<-fno-for-scope> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a I<for-init-statement> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.


=item B<-fno-gnu-keywords>

Do not recognize C<typeof> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword C<__typeof__> instead.
B<-ansi> implies B<-fno-gnu-keywords>.


=item B<-fno-implicit-templates>

Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.



=item B<-fno-implicit-inline-templates>

Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.


=item B<-fno-implement-inlines>

To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by B<#pragma implementation>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.


=item B<-fms-extensions>

Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.


=item B<-fno-nonansi-builtins>

Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include C<ffs>, C<alloca>, C<_exit>,
C<index>, C<bzero>, C<conjf>, and other related functions.


=item B<-fnothrow-opt>

Treat a C<throw()> exception specification as though it were a
C<noexcept> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification will actually make the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification will result in a call
to C<terminate> rather than C<unexpected>.


=item B<-fno-operator-names>

Do not treat the operator name keywords C<and>, C<bitand>,
C<bitor>, C<compl>, C<not>, C<or> and C<xor> as
synonyms as keywords.


=item B<-fno-optional-diags>

Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.


=item B<-fpermissive>

Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using B<-fpermissive> will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.


=item B<-fno-pretty-templates>

When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler will normally print the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. C<void f(T) [with T = int]>
rather than C<void f(int)>) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler will omit any template arguments which match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, using B<-fno-pretty-templates> will disable them.


=item B<-frepo>

Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies B<-fno-implicit-templates>.  


=item B<-fno-rtti>

Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features
(B<dynamic_cast> and B<typeid>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed. The B<dynamic_cast> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require runtime type information, i.e. casts to C<void *> or to
unambiguous base classes.


=item B<-fstats>

Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.


=item B<-fstrict-enums>

Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumeration type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value which can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumeration type.


=item B<-ftemplate-depth=>I<n>

Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to I<n>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C++0x).


=item B<-fno-threadsafe-statics>

Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.


=item B<-fuse-cxa-atexit>

Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
C<__cxa_atexit> function rather than the C<atexit> function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
C<__cxa_atexit>.


=item B<-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr>

Don't use the C<__cxa_get_exception_ptr> runtime routine.  This
will cause C<std::uncaught_exception> to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.


=item B<-fvisibility-inlines-hidden>

This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
were taken in different shared objects.

The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
C<__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.

The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.

You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.

Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.



=item B<-fvisibility-ms-compat>

This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:


=over 4


=item 1.

It sets the default visibility to C<hidden>, like
B<-fvisibility=hidden>.


=item 2.

Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.


=item 3.

The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications which are defined in more than one different
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they would have
been permitted when this option was not used.

=back


In new code it is better to use B<-fvisibility=hidden> and
export those classes which are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.

Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects will be different, so changing one will not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.


=item B<-fno-weak>

Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.


=item B<-nostdinc++>

Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.)

=back


In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:


=over 4


=item B<-fno-default-inline>

Do not assume B<inline> for functions defined inside a class scope.
  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.


=item B<-Wabi> (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.

You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

The known incompatibilities in B<-fabi-version=2> (the default) include:


=over 4



=item *

A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type is
mangled incorrectly:
	
	extern int N;
	template <int &> struct S {};
	void n (S<N>) {2}


This is fixed in B<-fabi-version=3>.


=item *

SIMD vector types declared using C<__attribute ((vector_size))> are
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.

The mangling is changed in B<-fabi-version=4>.

=back


The known incompatibilities in B<-fabi-version=1> include:


=over 4



=item *

Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:

	
	struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
	struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };


In this case, G++ will place C<B::f2> into the same byte
asC<A::f1>; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding C<A> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout C<B> identically.


=item *

Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:

	
	struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
	struct B { B(); char c2; };
	struct C : public A, public virtual B {};


In this case, G++ will not place C<B> into the tail-padding for
C<A>; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding C<A> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout C<C> identically.


=item *

Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:

	
	union U { int i : 4096; };


Assuming that an C<int> does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an C<int>.


=item *

Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:

	
	struct A {};
	
	struct B {
	  A a;
	  virtual void f ();
	};
	
	struct C : public B, public A {};


G++ will place the C<A> base class of C<C> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
C<A> data member of C<B> is already at offset zero.


=item *

Names of template functions whose types involve C<typename> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.

	
	template <typename Q>
	void f(typename Q::X) {}
	
	template <template <typename> class Q>
	void f(typename Q<int>::X) {}


Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.


=back


It also warns psABI related changes.  The known psABI changes at this
point include:


=over 4



=item *

For SYSV/x86-64, when passing union with long double, it is changed to
pass in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:

	
	union U {
	  long double ld;
	  int i;
	};


C<union U> will always be passed in memory.


=back



=item B<-Wctor-dtor-privacy> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.


=item B<-Wnoexcept> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. B<throw()> or B<noexcept>) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.


=item B<-Wnon-virtual-dtor> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when a class has virtual functions and accessible non-virtual
destructor, in which case it would be possible but unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to the base class.
This warning is also enabled if -Weffc++ is specified.


=item B<-Wreorder> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

	
	struct A {
	  int i;
	  int j;
	  A(): j (0), i (1) { }
	};


The compiler will rearrange the member initializers for B<i>
and B<j> to match the declaration order of the members, emitting
a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.

=back


The following B<-W...> options are not affected by B<-Wall>.


=over 4


=item B<-Weffc++> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
I<Effective C++> book:


=over 4


=item *

Item 11:  Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically allocated memory.


=item *

Item 12:  Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.


=item *

Item 14:  Make destructors virtual in base classes.


=item *

Item 15:  Have C<operator=> return a reference to C<*this>.


=item *

Item 23:  Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.


=back


Also warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
Scott Meyers' I<More Effective C++> book:


=over 4


=item *

Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.


=item *

Item 7:  Never overload C<&&>, C<||>, or C<,>.


=back


When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use B<grep -v>
to filter out those warnings.


=item B<-Wstrict-null-sentinel> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn also about the use of an uncasted C<NULL> as sentinel.  When
compiling only with GCC this is a valid sentinel, as C<NULL> is defined
to C<__null>.  Although it is a null pointer constant not a null pointer,
it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is
not portable across different compilers.


=item B<-Wno-non-template-friend> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
B<friend foo(int)>), the C++ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, B<-Wnon-template-friend> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
B<-Wno-non-template-friend> which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.


=item B<-Wold-style-cast> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a C++ program.  The new-style casts (B<dynamic_cast>,
B<static_cast>, B<reinterpret_cast>, and B<const_cast>) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.


=item B<-Woverloaded-virtual> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:

	
	struct A {
	  virtual void f();
	};
	
	struct B: public A {
	  void f(int);
	};


the C<A> class version of C<f> is hidden in C<B>, and code
like:

	
	B* b;
	b->f();


will fail to compile.


=item B<-Wno-pmf-conversions> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.


=item B<-Wsign-promo> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

	
	struct A {
	  operator int ();
	  A& operator = (int);
	};
	
	main ()
	{
	  A a,b;
	  a = b;
	}


In this example, G++ will synthesize a default B<A& operator =
(const A&);>, while cfront will use the user-defined B<operator =>.

=back



=head2 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects


(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent GNU compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file C<some_class.m> like this:

	
	gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m


In this example, B<-fgnu-runtime> is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by GCC.

Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
B<-Wtraditional>).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use
C++-specific options (e.g., B<-Wabi>).

Here is a list of options that are I<only> for compiling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs:


=over 4


=item B<-fconstant-string-class=>I<class-name>

Use I<class-name> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax C<@"...">.  The default
class name is C<NXConstantString> if the GNU runtime is being used, and
C<NSConstantString> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
B<-fconstant-cfstrings> option, if also present, will override the
B<-fconstant-string-class> setting and cause C<@"..."> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.


=item B<-fgnu-runtime>

Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.


=item B<-fnext-runtime>

Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro
C<__NEXT_RUNTIME__> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.


=item B<-fno-nil-receivers>

Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (C<[receiver
message:arg]>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not C<nil>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and ABI version 0 or 1.


=item B<-fobjc-abi-version=>I<n>

Use version I<n> of the Objective-C ABI for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI.  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.


=item B<-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors>

For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special C<- (id) .cxx_construct> instance method that will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return C<self>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C++ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special C<- (void) .cxx_destruct> method that will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.

The C<- (id) .cxx_construct> and C<- (void) .cxx_destruct>
methods thusly generated will only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The C<- (id) .cxx_construct> methods will be invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the C<- (void) .cxx_destruct> methods will be invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.

As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the C<- (id) .cxx_construct> and
C<- (void) .cxx_destruct> methods.


=item B<-fobjc-direct-dispatch>

Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.


=item B<-fobjc-exceptions>

Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords C<@try>,
C<@throw>, C<@catch>, C<@finally> and
C<@synchronized>.  This option is available with both the GNU
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).


=item B<-fobjc-gc>

Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
GNU runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.


=item B<-fobjc-nilcheck>

For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
B<-fno-objc-nilcheck>.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is used.


=item B<-fobjc-std=objc1>

Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/C++ language; it does not affect conformance to C/C++ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of GCC.


=item B<-freplace-objc-classes>

Emit a special marker instructing B<ld(1)> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow B<dyld(1)> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3
and later.


=item B<-fzero-link>

When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to C<objc_getClass("...")> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the B<-fzero-link> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to C<objc_getClass("...")>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to C<objc_get_class("...")>
regardless of command line options.


=item B<-gen-decls>

Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named F<I<sourcename>.decl>.


=item B<-Wassign-intercept> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.


=item B<-Wno-protocol> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the B<-Wno-protocol> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.


=item B<-Wselector> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a C<@selector(...)>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the B<-fsyntax-only> option is
being used.


=item B<-Wstrict-selector-match> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type C<id> or C<Class>.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types which share the same size
and alignment.


=item B<-Wundeclared-selector> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Warn if a C<@selector(...)> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
C<@selector(...)> expression, either explicitly in an
C<@interface> or C<@protocol> declaration, or implicitly in
an C<@implementation> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a C<@selector(...)> expression is found,
while B<-Wselector> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.


=item B<-print-objc-runtime-info>

Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by
value, if any.


=back



=head2 Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting


Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the C++ front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.


=over 4


=item B<-fmessage-length=>I<n>

Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about I<n>
characters.  The default is 72 characters for B<g++> and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by GCC.  If I<n> is zero, then no
line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.


=item B<-fdiagnostics-show-location=once>

Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit I<once> source location information; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.


=item B<-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line>

Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.


=item B<-fno-diagnostics-show-option>

By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text which indicates the
command line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
B<-fno-diagnostics-show-option> flag suppresses that behavior.


=item B<-Wcoverage-mismatch>

Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
B<-fprofile-use> option.
If a source file was changed between B<-fprofile-gen> and
B<-fprofile-use>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC can not use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  B<-Wno-coverage-mismatch> can be used to disable the
warning or B<-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch> can be used to
disable the error.  Disable the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code, so disabling the error is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

=head2 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings


Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.


=over 4


=item B<-fsyntax-only>

Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.


=item B<-fmax-errors=>I<n>

Limits the maximum number of error messages to I<n>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If I<n> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If B<-Wfatal-errors> is also
specified, then B<-Wfatal-errors> takes precedence over this
option.


=item B<-w>

Inhibit all warning messages.


=item B<-Werror>

Make all warnings into errors.


=item B<-Werror=>

Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended, for example B<-Werror=switch> turns the warnings
controlled by B<-Wswitch> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate B<-Werror> for specific
warnings, for example B<-Wno-error=switch> makes
B<-Wswitch> warnings not be errors, even when B<-Werror>
is in effect.

The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option which controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
B<-Werror=> and B<-Wno-error=> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
B<-fno-diagnostics-show-option> flag.)

Note that specifying B<-Werror=>I<foo> automatically implies
B<-W>I<foo>.  However, B<-Wno-error=>I<foo> does not
imply anything.


=item B<-Wfatal-errors>

This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.


=back


You can request many specific warnings with options beginning
B<-W>, for example B<-Wimplicit> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning B<-Wno-> to turn off warnings; for
example, B<-Wno-implicit>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further,
language-specific options also refer to B<C++ Dialect Options> and
B<Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options>.

When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
B<-Wunknown-warning>), GCC will emit a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the B<-Wno-> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: No diagnostic will be
produced for B<-Wno-unknown-warning> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new B<-Wno-> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler will
warn that an unrecognized option was used.


=over 4


=item B<-pedantic>

Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any B<-std> option used.

Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require B<-ansi> or a
B<-std> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

B<-pedantic> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with B<__>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
C<__extension__>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.


Some users try to use B<-pedantic> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for which
ISO C I<requires> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from B<-pedantic>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

Where the standard specified with B<-std> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as B<gnu90> or B<gnu99>, there is a
corresponding I<base standard>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from B<-pedantic> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)


=item B<-pedantic-errors>

Like B<-pedantic>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.


=item B<-Wall>

This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in B<C++ Dialect
Options> and B<Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options>.

B<-Wall> turns on the following warning flags:

B<-Waddress   
-Warray-bounds> (only withB< >B<-O2>)  
B<-Wc++0x-compat  
-Wchar-subscripts  
-Wenum-compare> (in C/Objc; this is on by default in C++) 
B<-Wimplicit-int> (C and Objective-C only) 
B<-Wimplicit-function-declaration> (C and Objective-C only) 
B<-Wcomment  
-Wformat   
-Wmain> (only for C/ObjC and unlessB< >B<-ffreestanding>)  
B<-Wmissing-braces  
-Wnonnull  
-Wparentheses  
-Wpointer-sign  
-Wreorder   
-Wreturn-type  
-Wsequence-point  
-Wsign-compare> (only in C++)  
B<-Wstrict-aliasing  
-Wstrict-overflow=1  
-Wswitch  
-Wtrigraphs  
-Wuninitialized  
-Wunknown-pragmas  
-Wunused-function  
-Wunused-label     
-Wunused-value     
-Wunused-variable  
-Wvolatile-register-var> 


Note that some warning flags are not implied by B<-Wall>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by B<-Wextra> but many of
them must be enabled individually.


=item B<-Wextra>

This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
B<-Wall>. (This option used to be called B<-W>.  The older
name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

B<-Wclobbered  
-Wempty-body  
-Wignored-qualifiers 
-Wmissing-field-initializers  
-Wmissing-parameter-type> (C only)  
B<-Wold-style-declaration> (C only)  
B<-Woverride-init  
-Wsign-compare  
-Wtype-limits  
-Wuninitialized  
-Wunused-parameter> (only withB< >B<-Wunused>B< >orB< >B<-Wall>) 
B<-Wunused-but-set-parameter> (only withB< >B<-Wunused>B< >orB< >B<-Wall>)  B<
>

The option B<-Wextra> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:


=over 4



=item *

A pointer is compared against integer zero with B<E<lt>>, B<E<lt>=>,
B<E<gt>>, or B<E<gt>=>.


=item *

(C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a
conditional expression.


=item *

(C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.


=item *

(C++ only) Subscripting an array which has been declared B<register>.


=item *

(C++ only) Taking the address of a variable which has been declared
B<register>.


=item *

(C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a derived class' copy
constructor.


=back



=item B<-Wchar-subscripts>

Warn if an array subscript has type C<char>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wcomment>

Warn whenever a comment-start sequence B</*> appears in a B</*>
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a B<//> comment.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wno-cpp>

(C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)

Suppress warning messages emitted by C<#warning> directives.


=item B<-Wdouble-promotion> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Give a warning when a value of type C<float> is implicitly
promoted to C<double>.  CPUs with a 32-bit "single-precision"
floating-point unit implement C<float> in hardware, but emulate
C<double> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using C<double> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.  

It is easy to accidentally do computations with C<double> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type C<double>.  For
example, in:
	
	float area(float radius)
	{
	   return 3.14159 * radius * radius;        
	}

the compiler will perform the entire computation with C<double>
because the floating-point literal is a C<double>.


=item B<-Wformat>

Check calls to C<printf> and C<scanf>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes, in the C<printf>,
C<scanf>, C<strftime> and C<strfmon> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
B<-ffreestanding> or B<-fno-builtin>.

The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if B<-pedantic> is used
with B<-Wformat>, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for C<strfmon> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  

Since B<-Wformat> also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, B<-Wformat> also implies B<-Wnonnull>.

B<-Wformat> is included in B<-Wall>.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options B<-Wformat-y2k>,
B<-Wno-format-extra-args>, B<-Wno-format-zero-length>,
B<-Wformat-nonliteral>, B<-Wformat-security>, and
B<-Wformat=2> are available, but are not included in B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wformat-y2k>

If B<-Wformat> is specified, also warn about C<strftime>
formats which may yield only a two-digit year.


=item B<-Wno-format-contains-nul>

If B<-Wformat> is specified, do not warn about format strings that
contain NUL bytes.


=item B<-Wno-format-extra-args>

If B<-Wformat> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
C<printf> or C<scanf> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.

Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with B<$> operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to C<va_arg> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of C<scanf> formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.


=item B<-Wno-format-zero-length> (C and Objective-C only)

If B<-Wformat> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.


=item B<-Wformat-nonliteral>

If B<-Wformat> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a C<va_list>.


=item B<-Wformat-security>

If B<-Wformat> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to C<printf> and C<scanf> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in C<printf (foo);>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains B<%n>.  (This is
currently a subset of what B<-Wformat-nonliteral> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to B<-Wformat-security> that are not
included in B<-Wformat-nonliteral>.)


=item B<-Wformat=2>

Enable B<-Wformat> plus format checks not included in
B<-Wformat>.  Currently equivalent to B<-Wformat
-Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k>.


=item B<-Wnonnull> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the C<nonnull> function attribute.

B<-Wnonnull> is included in B<-Wall> and B<-Wformat>.  It
can be disabled with the B<-Wno-nonnull> option.


=item B<-Winit-self> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the B<-Wuninitialized> option.

For example, GCC will warn about C<i> being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when B<-Winit-self> has been specified:
	
	int f()
	{
	  int i = i;
	  return i;
	}



=item B<-Wimplicit-int> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wimplicit-function-declaration> (C and Objective-C only)

Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared. In
C99 mode (B<-std=c99> or B<-std=gnu99>), this warning is
enabled by default and it is made into an error by
B<-pedantic-errors>. This warning is also enabled by
B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wimplicit> (C and Objective-C only)

Same as B<-Wimplicit-int> and B<-Wimplicit-function-declaration>.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wignored-qualifiers> (C and C++ only)

Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as C<const>.  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or C<void>.
ISO C prohibits qualified C<void> return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.

This warning is also enabled by B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wmain>

Warn if the type of B<main> is suspicious.  B<main> should be
a function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This warning
is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by either B<-Wall>
or B<-pedantic>.


=item B<-Wmissing-braces>

Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for B<a> is not fully
bracketed, but that for B<b> is fully bracketed.

	
	int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
	int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };


This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wmissing-include-dirs> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)

Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.


=item B<-Wparentheses>

Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

Also warn if a comparison like B<xE<lt>=yE<lt>=z> appears; this is
equivalent to B<(xE<lt>=y ? 1 : 0) E<lt>= z>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
C<if> statement an C<else> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:

	
	{
	  if (a)
	    if (b)
	      foo ();
	  else
	    bar ();
	}


In C/C++, every C<else> branch belongs to the innermost possible
C<if> statement, which in this example is C<if (b)>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost C<if> statement so there is no way the C<else>
could belong to the enclosing C<if>.  The resulting code would
look like this:

	
	{
	  if (a)
	    {
	      if (b)
	        foo ();
	      else
	        bar ();
	    }
	}


Also warn for dangerous uses of the 
?: with omitted middle operand GNU extension. When the condition
in the ?: operator is a boolean expression the omitted value will
be always 1. Often the user expects it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead. 

This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wsequence-point>

Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

The C and C++ standards defines the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of I<sequence points>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
C<&&>, C<||>, C<? :> or C<,> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that "Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

Examples of code with undefined behavior are C<a = a++;>, C<a[n]
= b[n++]> and C<a[i++] = i;>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
E<lt>B<http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html>E<gt>.

This warning is enabled by B<-Wall> for C and C++.


=item B<-Wreturn-type>

Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults
to C<int>.  Also warn about any C<return> statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not C<void>
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value), and about a C<return> statement with an
expression in a function whose return-type is C<void>.

For C++, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when B<-Wno-return-type> is specified.  The only
exceptions are B<main> and functions defined in system headers.

This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wswitch>

Warn whenever a C<switch> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a C<case> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a C<default> label prevents this
warning.)  C<case> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
C<default> label).
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wswitch-default>

Warn whenever a C<switch> statement does not have a C<default>
case.


=item B<-Wswitch-enum>

Warn whenever a C<switch> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a C<case> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  C<case> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between B<-Wswitch> and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
C<default> label.


=item B<-Wsync-nand> (C and C++ only)

Warn when C<__sync_fetch_and_nand> and C<__sync_nand_and_fetch>
built-in functions are used.  These functions changed semantics in GCC 4.4.


=item B<-Wtrigraphs>

Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of
the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned about).
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wunused-but-set-parameter>

Warn whenever a function parameter is assigned to, but otherwise unused
(aside from its declaration).

To suppress this warning use the B<unused> attribute.

This warning is also enabled by B<-Wunused> together with
B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wunused-but-set-variable>

Warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise unused
(aside from its declaration).
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.

To suppress this warning use the B<unused> attribute.

This warning is also enabled by B<-Wunused>, which is enabled
by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wunused-function>

Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
non-inline static function is unused.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wunused-label>

Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.

To suppress this warning use the B<unused> attribute.


=item B<-Wunused-parameter>

Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.

To suppress this warning use the B<unused> attribute.


=item B<-Wno-unused-result>

Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
C<warn_unused_result> does not use
its return value. The default is B<-Wunused-result>.


=item B<-Wunused-variable>

Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused
aside from its declaration.
This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.

To suppress this warning use the B<unused> attribute.


=item B<-Wunused-value>

Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
B<void>. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as B<x[i,j]> will cause a warning, while
B<x[(void)i,j]> will not.

This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wunused>

All the above B<-Wunused> options combined.

In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify B<-Wextra -Wunused> (note that B<-Wall> implies
B<-Wunused>), or separately specify B<-Wunused-parameter>.


=item B<-Wuninitialized>

Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a C<setjmp> call. In C++,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static B<const> member
appears in a class without constructors.

If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the B<-Winit-self> option.

These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared C<volatile>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.

Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

	
	{
	  int x;
	  switch (y)
	    {
	    case 1: x = 1;
	      break;
	    case 2: x = 4;
	      break;
	    case 3: x = 5;
	    }
	  foo (x);
	}


If the value of C<y> is always 1, 2 or 3, then C<x> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:

	
	{
	  int save_y;
	  if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
	  ...
	  if (change_y) y = save_y;
	}


This has no bug because C<save_y> is used only if it is set.

This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to C<longjmp>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.

The compiler sees only the calls to C<setjmp>.  It cannot know
where C<longjmp> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because C<longjmp> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.

Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as C<noreturn>.  

This warning is enabled by B<-Wall> or B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wunknown-pragmas>

Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by
GCC.  If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the B<-Wall> command line option.


=item B<-Wno-pragmas>

Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
B<-Wunknown-pragmas>.


=item B<-Wstrict-aliasing>

This option is only active when B<-fstrict-aliasing> is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in B<-Wall>.
It is equivalent to B<-Wstrict-aliasing=3>


=item B<-Wstrict-aliasing=n>

This option is only active when B<-fstrict-aliasing> is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way -O works.
B<-Wstrict-aliasing> is equivalent to B<-Wstrict-aliasing=n>,
with n=3.

Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but -fstrict-aliasing still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the frontend only.

Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the frontend only.

Level 3 (default for B<-Wstrict-aliasing>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the frontend:
C<*(int*)&some_float>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the backend, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow>


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow=>I<n>

This option is only active when B<-fstrict-overflow> is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code which is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.


=over 4


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow=1>

Warn about cases which are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example: C<x + 1 E<gt> x>; with B<-fstrict-overflow>, the
compiler will simplify this to C<1>.  This level of
B<-Wstrict-overflow> is enabled by B<-Wall>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow=2>

Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: C<abs (x) E<gt>= 0>.  This can only be
simplified when B<-fstrict-overflow> is in effect, because
C<abs (INT_MIN)> overflows to C<INT_MIN>, which is less than
zero.  B<-Wstrict-overflow> (with no level) is the same as
B<-Wstrict-overflow=2>.


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow=3>

Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: C<x + 1 E<gt> 1> will be simplified to C<x E<gt> 0>.


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow=4>

Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: C<(x * 10) / 5> will be simplified to C<x * 2>.


=item B<-Wstrict-overflow=5>

Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: C<x + 2 E<gt> y> will
be simplified to C<x + 1 E<gt>= y>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level will give a very large number of
false positives.

=back



=item B<-Wsuggest-attribute=>[B<pure>|B<const>|B<noreturn>]

Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial. The
attributes currently supported are listed below.


=over 4


=item B<-Wsuggest-attribute=pure>


=item B<-Wsuggest-attribute=const>


=item B<-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn>


Warn about functions which might be candidates for attributes
C<pure>, C<const> or C<noreturn>.  The compiler only warns for
functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of C<pure> and
C<const>) if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function
returns normally if it doesn't contain an infinite loop nor returns abnormally
by throwing, calling C<abort()> or trapping.  This analysis requires option
B<-fipa-pure-const>, which is enabled by default at B<-O> and
higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.

=back



=item B<-Warray-bounds>

This option is only active when B<-ftree-vrp> is active
(default for B<-O2> and above). It warns about subscripts to arrays
that are always out of bounds. This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wno-div-by-zero>

Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating point
division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of
obtaining infinities and NaNs.


=item B<-Wsystem-headers>

Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using B<-Wall> in conjunction with this
option will I<not> warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers---for that, B<-Wunknown-pragmas> must also be used.


=item B<-Wtrampolines>

 Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
 
 A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
 time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and
 is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it
 is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But,
 for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack
 to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.


=item B<-Wfloat-equal>

Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.

The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.


=item B<-Wtraditional> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.


=over 4


=item *

Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.


=item *

In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the B<#> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
B<-Wtraditional> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the B<#> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
B<#pragma> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize B<#elif>, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.


=item *

A function-like macro that appears without arguments.


=item *

The unary plus operator.


=item *

The B<U> integer constant suffix, or the B<F> or B<L> floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the B<L> suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the B<_MIN>/B<_MAX> macros in C<E<lt>limits.hE<gt>>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.


=item *

A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.


=item *

A C<switch> statement has an operand of type C<long>.


=item *

A non-C<static> function declaration follows a C<static> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.


=item *

The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.


=item *

Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.


=item *

Initialization of automatic aggregates.


=item *

Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.


=item *

Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. C<__STDC__> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.


=item *

Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use B<-Wtraditional-conversion>.


=item *

Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
I<not> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, C<PARAMS> and
C<VPARAMS>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

=back



=item B<-Wtraditional-conversion> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.


=item B<-Wdeclaration-after-statement> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is by default
allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90 and was not supported by
GCC versions before GCC 3.0.  


=item B<-Wundef>

Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an B<#if> directive.


=item B<-Wno-endif-labels>

Do not warn whenever an B<#else> or an B<#endif> are followed by text.


=item B<-Wshadow>

Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable,
parameter, type, or class member (in C++), or whenever a built-in function
is shadowed. Note that in C++, the compiler will not warn if a local variable
shadows a struct/class/enum, but will warn if it shadows an explicit typedef.


=item B<-Wlarger-than=>I<len>

Warn whenever an object of larger than I<len> bytes is defined.


=item B<-Wframe-larger-than=>I<len>

Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than I<len> bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate
and not conservative.
The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than I<len>
even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated
via C<alloca>, variable-length arrays, or related constructs
is not included by the compiler when determining
whether or not to issue a warning.


=item B<-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations>

Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler could not
assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.  With
B<-funsafe-loop-optimizations> warn if the compiler made
such assumptions.


=item B<-Wno-pedantic-ms-format> (MinGW targets only)

Disables the warnings about non-ISO C<printf> / C<scanf> format
width specifiers C<I32>, C<I64>, and C<I> used on Windows targets
depending on the MS runtime, when you are using the options B<-Wformat>
and B<-pedantic> without gnu-extensions.


=item B<-Wpointer-arith>

Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type or
of C<void>.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with C<void *> pointers and pointers
to functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
C<NULL>.  This warning is also enabled by B<-pedantic>.


=item B<-Wtype-limits>

Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the limited
range of the data type, but do not warn for constant expressions.  For
example, warn if an unsigned variable is compared against zero with
B<E<lt>> or B<E<gt>=>.  This warning is also enabled by
B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wbad-function-cast> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if C<int malloc()> is cast to C<anything *>.


=item B<-Wc++-compat> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common subset of
ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit conversion from
C<void *> to a pointer to non-C<void> type.


=item B<-Wc++0x-compat> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++ 1998 and
ISO C++ 200x, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998 that will become keywords
in ISO C++ 200x.  This warning is enabled by B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wcast-qual>

Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a C<const char *> is cast
to an ordinary C<char *>.

Also warn when making a cast which introduces a type qualifier in an
unsafe way.  For example, casting C<char **> to C<const char **>
is unsafe, as in this example:

	
	  /* p is char ** value.  */
	  const char **q = (const char **) p;
	  /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */
	  *q = "string";
	  /* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */
	  **p = 'b';



=item B<-Wcast-align>

Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a C<char *> is cast to
an C<int *> on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two- or four-byte boundaries.


=item B<-Wwrite-strings>

When compiling C, give string constants the type C<const
char[I<length>]> so that copying the address of one into a
non-C<const> C<char *> pointer will get a warning.  These
warnings will help you find at compile time code that can try to write
into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
using C<const> in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will
just be a nuisance. This is why we did not make B<-Wall> request
these warnings.

When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from string
literals to C<char *>.  This warning is enabled by default for C++
programs.


=item B<-Wclobbered>

Warn for variables that might be changed by B<longjmp> or
B<vfork>.  This warning is also enabled by B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wconversion>

Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This includes
conversions between real and integer, like C<abs (x)> when
C<x> is C<double>; conversions between signed and unsigned,
like C<unsigned ui = -1>; and conversions to smaller types, like
C<sqrtf (M_PI)>. Do not warn for explicit casts like C<abs
((int) x)> and C<ui = (unsigned) -1>, or if the value is not
changed by the conversion like in C<abs (2.0)>.  Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
using B<-Wno-sign-conversion>.

For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined
conversions; and conversions that will never use a type conversion
operator: conversions to C<void>, the same type, a base class or a
reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers are disabled by default in C++ unless
B<-Wsign-conversion> is explicitly enabled.


=item B<-Wno-conversion-null> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Do not warn for conversions between C<NULL> and non-pointer
types. B<-Wconversion-null> is enabled by default.


=item B<-Wempty-body>

Warn if an empty body occurs in an B<if>, B<else> or B<do
while> statement.  This warning is also enabled by B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wenum-compare>

Warn about a comparison between values of different enum types. In C++
this warning is enabled by default.  In C this warning is enabled by
B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wjump-misses-init> (C, Objective-C only)

Warn if a C<goto> statement or a C<switch> statement jumps
forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns about
variables which are initialized when they are declared.  This warning is
only supported for C and Objective C; in C++ this sort of branch is an
error in any case.

B<-Wjump-misses-init> is included in B<-Wc++-compat>.  It
can be disabled with the B<-Wno-jump-misses-init> option.


=item B<-Wsign-compare>

Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by B<-Wextra>; to get the other warnings
of B<-Wextra> without this warning, use B<-Wextra -Wno-sign-compare>.


=item B<-Wsign-conversion>

Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer
value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an unsigned
integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
option is enabled also by B<-Wconversion>.


=item B<-Waddress>

Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
C<void func(void); if (func)>, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as C<if (x == "abc")>.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use C<strcmp>.  This warning is enabled by
B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wlogical-op>

Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
This includes using logical operators in contexts where a
bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.


=item B<-Waggregate-return>

Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)


=item B<-Wno-attributes>

Do not warn if an unexpected C<__attribute__> is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This will not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.


=item B<-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined>

Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses
warnings for redefinition of C<__TIMESTAMP__>, C<__TIME__>,
C<__DATE__>, C<__FILE__>, and C<__BASE_FILE__>.


=item B<-Wstrict-prototypes> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)


=item B<-Wold-style-declaration> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like
C<static> are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
is also enabled by B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wold-style-definition> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.


=item B<-Wmissing-parameter-type> (C and Objective-C only)

A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&R-style
functions:

	
	void foo(bar) { }


This warning is also enabled by B<-Wextra>.


=item B<-Wmissing-prototypes> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.


=item B<-Wmissing-declarations>

Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C++, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.


=item B<-Wmissing-field-initializers>

Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
C<x.h> is implicitly zero:

	
	struct s { int f, g, h; };
	struct s x = { 3, 4 };


This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification would not trigger a warning:

	
	struct s { int f, g, h; };
	struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };


This warning is included in B<-Wextra>.  To get other B<-Wextra>
warnings without this one, use B<-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers>.


=item B<-Wmissing-format-attribute>

Warn about function pointers which might be candidates for C<format>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
GCC will guess that function pointers with C<format> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding C<format> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a C<format>
attribute to avoid the warning.

GCC will also warn about function definitions which might be
candidates for C<format> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC will guess that C<format> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
C<vprintf> or C<vscanf>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which C<format> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.


=item B<-Wno-multichar>

Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (B<'FOOF'>) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.


=item B<-Wnormalized=E<lt>none|id|nfc|nfkcE<gt>>

In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some I<normalization rules> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers which
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

There are four levels of warning that GCC supports.  The default is
B<-Wnormalized=nfc>, which warns about any identifier which is
not in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, I<NFC>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.

Unfortunately, there are some characters which ISO C and ISO C++ allow
in identifiers that when turned into NFC aren't allowable as
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
B<-Wnormalized=id> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.

You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
B<-Wnormalized=none>.  You would only want to do this if you
were using some other normalization scheme (like "D"), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.

Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance C<\u207F>, "SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N", will display just like a regular C<n> which has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the I<NFKC>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC will warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use
B<-Wnormalized=nfkc>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is
unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.


=item B<-Wno-deprecated>

Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  


=item B<-Wno-deprecated-declarations>

Do not warn about uses of functions,
variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the C<deprecated>
attribute.


=item B<-Wno-overflow>

Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.


=item B<-Woverride-init> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.

This warning is included in B<-Wextra>.  To get other
B<-Wextra> warnings without this one, use B<-Wextra
-Wno-override-init>.


=item B<-Wpacked>

Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable C<f.x> in C<struct bar>
will be misaligned even though C<struct bar> does not itself
have the packed attribute:

	
	struct foo {
	  int x;
	  char a, b, c, d;
	} __attribute__((packed));
	struct bar {
	  char z;
	  struct foo f;
	};



=item B<-Wpacked-bitfield-compat>

The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the C<packed> attribute
on bit-fields of type C<char>.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field C<a>
and C<b> in this structure:

	
	struct foo
	{
	  char a:4;
	  char b:8;
	} __attribute__ ((packed));


This warning is enabled by default.  Use
B<-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat> to disable this warning.


=item B<-Wpadded>

Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.


=item B<-Wredundant-decls>

Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.


=item B<-Wnested-externs> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn if an C<extern> declaration is encountered within a function.


=item B<-Winline>

Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by B<-Winline> to appear or disappear.


=item B<-Wno-invalid-offsetof> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

Suppress warnings from applying the B<offsetof> macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying B<offsetof>
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
however, B<offsetof> typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
B<struct> that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

The restrictions on B<offsetof> may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++ standard.


=item B<-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast>

Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size. In C++, casting to a pointer type of smaller size is
an error. B<Wint-to-pointer-cast> is enabled by default.



=item B<-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast> (C and Objective-C only)

Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.


=item B<-Winvalid-pch>

Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.


=item B<-Wlong-long>

Warn if B<long long> type is used.  This is enabled by either
B<-pedantic> or B<-Wtraditional> in ISO C90 and C++98
modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use B<-Wno-long-long>.


=item B<-Wvariadic-macros>

Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic ISO C90 mode, or the GNU
alternate syntax when in pedantic ISO C99 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use B<-Wno-variadic-macros>.


=item B<-Wvla>

Warn if variable length array is used in the code.
B<-Wno-vla> will prevent the B<-pedantic> warning of
the variable length array.


=item B<-Wvolatile-register-var>

Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
B<-Wall>.


=item B<-Wdisabled-optimization>

Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.


=item B<-Wpointer-sign> (C and Objective-C only)

Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
B<-Wall> and by B<-pedantic>, which can be disabled with
B<-Wno-pointer-sign>.


=item B<-Wstack-protector>

This option is only active when B<-fstack-protector> is active.  It
warns about functions that will not be protected against stack smashing.


=item B<-Wno-mudflap>

Suppress warnings about constructs that cannot be instrumented by
B<-fmudflap>.


=item B<-Woverlength-strings>

Warn about string constants which are longer than the "minimum
maximum" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants which are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.

The limit applies I<after> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

This option is implied by B<-pedantic>, and can be disabled with
B<-Wno-overlength-strings>.


=item B<-Wunsuffixed-float-constants> (C and Objective-C only)


GCC will issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with B<-Wsystem-headers> it will
warn about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the C<FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64> pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.

=head2 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC


GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:


=over 4


=item B<-g>

Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

On most systems that use stabs format, B<-g> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use B<-gstabs+>, B<-gstabs>,
B<-gxcoff+>, B<-gxcoff>, or B<-gvms> (see below).

GCC allows you to use B<-g> with
B<-O>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.

Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.


=item B<-ggdb>

Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.


=item B<-gstabs>

Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by DBX or SDB.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.


=item B<-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols>

Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.


=item B<-femit-class-debug-always>

Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option will increase the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.


=item B<-gstabs+>

Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.


=item B<-gcoff>

Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.


=item B<-gxcoff>

Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.


=item B<-gxcoff+>

Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.


=item B<-gdwarf->I<version>

Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.  The value
of I<version> may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version is 2.

Note that with DWARF version 2 some ports require, and will always
use, some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.

Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and B<-fvar-tracking-assignments>
for maximum benefit.


=item B<-gstrict-dwarf>

Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected
with B<-gdwarf->I<version>.  On most targets using non-conflicting
DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed.


=item B<-gno-strict-dwarf>

Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with
B<-gdwarf->I<version>.


=item B<-gvms>

Produce debugging information in VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on VMS systems.


=item B<-g>I<level>


=item B<-ggdb>I<level>


=item B<-gstabs>I<level>


=item B<-gcoff>I<level>


=item B<-gxcoff>I<level>


=item B<-gvms>I<level>

Request debugging information and also use I<level> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.

Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, B<-g0> negates
B<-g>.

Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.

Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use B<-g3>.

B<-gdwarf-2> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
GCC used to support an option B<-gdwarf> that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional B<-g>I<level> option to change the
debug level for DWARF.


=item B<-gtoggle>

Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option would have
generated it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter, it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
B<-fcompare-debug>.


=item B<-fdump-final-insns>[B<=>I<file>]

Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to I<file>.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if I<file> is C<.>), the name
of the dump file will be determined by appending C<.gkd> to the
compilation output file name.


=item B<-fcompare-debug>[B<=>I<opts>]

If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding I<opts> and B<-fcompare-debug-second> to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.

If the equal sign is omitted, the default B<-gtoggle> is used.

The environment variable B<GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG>, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables B<-fcompare-debug>.  If
B<GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG> is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for I<opts>, otherwise the default B<-gtoggle>
is used.

B<-fcompare-debug=>, with the equal sign but without I<opts>,
is equivalent to B<-fno-compare-debug>, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
B<GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG> from taking effect.

To verify full coverage during B<-fcompare-debug> testing, set
B<GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG> to say B<-fcompare-debug-not-overridden>,
which GCC will reject as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting B<GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG> to B<-w%n-fcompare-debug
not overridden> will do.


=item B<-fcompare-debug-second>

This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by B<-fcompare-debug>, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
C<.gk> additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.

When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
I<first> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.


=item B<-feliminate-dwarf2-dups>

Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating DWARF2 debugging information with B<-gdwarf-2>.


=item B<-femit-struct-debug-baseonly>

Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the struct was defined.

This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,
but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See B<-femit-struct-debug-reduced> for a less aggressive option.
See B<-femit-struct-debug-detailed> for more detailed control.

This option works only with DWARF 2.


=item B<-femit-struct-debug-reduced>

Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the type was defined,
unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header.

This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information,
with some potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See B<-femit-struct-debug-baseonly> for a more aggressive option.
See B<-femit-struct-debug-detailed> for more detailed control.

This option works only with DWARF 2.


=item B<-femit-struct-debug-detailed>[B<=>I<spec-list>]

Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler will generate debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.

This option is a detailed version of
B<-femit-struct-debug-reduced> and B<-femit-struct-debug-baseonly>,
which will serve for most needs.

A specification has the syntax[B<dir:>|B<ind:>][B<ord:>|B<gen:>](B<any>|B<sys>|B<base>|B<none>)

The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (B<dir:>) or used indirectly (B<ind:>).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct would be legal, the use is indirect.
An example is
B<struct one direct; struct two * indirect;>.

The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (B<ord:>) or generic structs (B<gen:>).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but B<-femit-struct-debug-detailed> does not yet implement them.

The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler will emit debug information.
The values B<none> and B<any> have the normal meaning.
The value B<base> means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that
types declared in F<foo.c> and F<foo.h> will have debug information,
but types declared in other header will not.
The value B<sys> means those types satisfying B<base>
or declared in system or compiler headers.

You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.

The default is B<-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all>.

This option works only with DWARF 2.


=item B<-fenable-icf-debug>

Generate additional debug information to support identical code folding (ICF).
This option only works with DWARF version 2 or higher.


=item B<-fno-merge-debug-strings>

Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information which are identical in different object files.  Merging is
not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases the size
of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing
link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.


=item B<-fdebug-prefix-map=>I<old>B<=>I<new>

When compiling files in directory F<I<old>>, record debugging
information describing them as in F<I<new>> instead.


=item B<-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm>

Emit DWARF 2 unwind info as compiler generated C<.eh_frame> section
instead of using GAS C<.cfi_*> directives.


=item B<-p>

Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program B<prof>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.


=item B<-pg>

Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program B<gprof>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.


=item B<-Q>

Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.


=item B<-ftime-report>

Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.


=item B<-fmem-report>

Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.


=item B<-fpre-ipa-mem-report>


=item B<-fpost-ipa-mem-report>

Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.


=item B<-fstack-usage>

Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
F<.su> to the I<auxname>.  I<auxname> is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:


=over 4


=item *

The name of the function.

=item *

A number of bytes.

=item *

One or more qualifiers: C<static>, C<dynamic>, C<bounded>.

=back


The qualifier C<static> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.

The qualifier C<dynamic> means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier C<bounded> is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile-time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile-time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.


=item B<-fprofile-arcs>

Add code so that program flow I<arcs> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
F<I<auxname>.gcda> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (B<-fbranch-probabilities>), or for
test coverage analysis (B<-ftest-coverage>).  Each object file's
I<auxname> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. F<foo.gcda> for input file F<dir/foo.c>, or
F<dir/foo.gcda> for output file specified as B<-o dir/foo.o>).



=item B<--coverage>


This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for B<-fprofile-arcs>
B<-ftest-coverage> (when compiling) and B<-lgcov> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.


=over 4



=item *

Compile the source files with B<-fprofile-arcs> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional B<-ftest-coverage> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.


=item *

Link your object files with B<-lgcov> or B<-fprofile-arcs>
(the latter implies the former).


=item *

Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
C<fork> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).


=item *

For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
B<-fbranch-probabilities>.


=item *

For test coverage analysis, use B<gcov> to produce human readable
information from the F<.gcno> and F<.gcda> files.  Refer to the
B<gcov> documentation for further information.


=back


With B<-fprofile-arcs>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.


=item B<-ftest-coverage>

Produce a notes file that the B<gcov> code-coverage utility can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
F<I<auxname>.gcno>.  Refer to the B<-fprofile-arcs> option
above for a description of I<auxname> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data will match the source files
more closely, if you do not optimize.


=item B<-fdbg-cnt-list>

Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.


=item B<-fdbg-cnt=>I<counter-value-list>

Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  I<counter-value-list>
is a comma-separated list of I<name>:I<value> pairs
which sets the upper bound of each debug counter I<name> to I<value>.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of I<UINT_MAX>,
thus dbg_cnt() returns true always unless the upper bound is set by this option.
e.g. With -fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0
dbg_cnt(dce) will return true only for first 10 invocations
and dbg_cnt(tail_call) will return false always.


=item B<-d>I<letters>


=item B<-fdump-rtl->I<pass>

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
I<letters>.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the I<dumpname>, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file.  Note that the pass
number is computed statically as passes get registered into the pass
manager.  Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of
execution of passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin
could have a number over 200 even if it executed quite early.
I<dumpname> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. These switches may have different effects
when B<-E> is used for preprocessing.

Debug dumps can be enabled with a B<-fdump-rtl> switch or some
B<-d> option I<letters>.  Here are the possible
letters for use in I<pass> and I<letters>, and their meanings:

Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in addition to
normal output.


=item B<-dH>

Produce a core dump whenever an error occurs.


=item B<-dm>

Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the run, to
standard error.


=item B<-dp>

Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating which
pattern and alternative was used.  The length of each instruction is
also printed.


=item B<-dP>

Dump the RTL in the assembler output as a comment before each instruction.
Also turns on B<-dp> annotation.


=item B<-dv>

For each of the other indicated dump files (B<-fdump-rtl->I<pass>),
dump a representation of the control flow graph suitable for viewing with VCG
to F<I<file>.I<pass>.vcg>.


=item B<-dx>

Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.  Usually used
with B<-fdump-rtl-expand>.

=back



=item B<-fdump-noaddr>

When doing debugging dumps, suppress address output.  This makes it more
feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler invocations with
different compiler binaries and/or different
text / bss / data / heap / stack / dso start locations.


=item B<-fdump-unnumbered>

When doing debugging dumps, suppress instruction numbers and address output.
This makes it more feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler
invocations with different options, in particular with and without
B<-g>.


=item B<-fdump-unnumbered-links>

When doing debugging dumps (see B<-d> option above), suppress
instruction numbers for the links to the previous and next instructions
in a sequence.


=item B<-fdump-translation-unit> (C++ only)


=item B<-fdump-translation-unit->I<options>B< >(C++ only)

Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire translation
unit to a file.  The file name is made by appending F<.tu> to the
source file name, and the file is created in the same directory as the
output file.  If the B<->I<options> form is used, I<options>
controls the details of the dump as described for the
B<-fdump-tree> options.


=item B<-fdump-class-hierarchy> (C++ only)


=item B<-fdump-class-hierarchy->I<options>B< >(C++ only)

Dump a representation of each class's hierarchy and virtual function
table layout to a file.  The file name is made by appending
F<.class> to the source file name, and the file is created in the
same directory as the output file.  If the B<->I<options> form
is used, I<options> controls the details of the dump as described
for the B<-fdump-tree> options.


=item B<-fdump-ipa->I<switch>

Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural analysis
language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a
switch specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is created
in the same directory as the output file.  The following dumps are
possible:


=over 4


=item B<all>

Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.


=item B<cgraph>

Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused function removal,
and inlining decisions.


=item B<inline>

Dump after function inlining.


=back



=item B<-fdump-statistics->I<option>

Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate file.  The
file name is generated by appending a suffix ending in
B<.statistics> to the source file name, and the file is created in
the same directory as the output file.  If the B<->I<option>
form is used, B<-stats> will cause counters to be summed over the
whole compilation unit while B<-details> will dump every event as
the passes generate them.  The default with no option is to sum
counters for each function compiled.


=item B<-fdump-tree->I<switch>


=item B<-fdump-tree->I<switch>B<->I<options>

Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate
language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a
switch specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is
created in the same directory as the output file.  If the
B<->I<options> form is used, I<options> is a list of
B<-> separated options that control the details of the dump.  Not
all options are applicable to all dumps, those which are not
meaningful will be ignored.  The following options are available


=over 4


=item B<address>

Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it
changes according to the environment and source file.  Its primary use
is for tying up a dump file with a debug environment.

=item B<asmname>

If C<DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME> has been set for a given decl, use that
in the dump instead of C<DECL_NAME>.  Its primary use is ease of
use working backward from mangled names in the assembly file.

=item B<slim>

Inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a function merely
because that scope has been reached.  Only dump such items when they
are directly reachable by some other path.  When dumping pretty-printed
trees, this option inhibits dumping the bodies of control structures.

=item B<raw>

Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default, trees are
pretty-printed into a C-like representation.

=item B<details>

Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option).

=item B<stats>

Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored by every dump
option).

=item B<blocks>

Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).

=item B<vops>

Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.

=item B<lineno>

Enable showing line numbers for statements.

=item B<uid>

Enable showing the unique ID (C<DECL_UID>) for each variable.

=item B<verbose>

Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.

=item B<eh>

Enable showing the EH region number holding each statement.

=item B<all>

Turn on all options, except B<raw>, B<slim>, B<verbose>
and B<lineno>.

=back


The following tree dumps are possible:

=over 4



=item B<original>

Dump before any tree based optimization, to F<I<file>.original>.


=item B<optimized>

Dump after all tree based optimization, to F<I<file>.optimized>.

Dump the control flow graph of each function to a file.  The file name is
made by appending F<.cfg> to the source file name.


=item B<vcg>

Dump the control flow graph of each function to a file in VCG format.  The
file name is made by appending F<.vcg> to the source file name.  Note
that if the file contains more than one function, the generated file cannot
be used directly by VCG.  You will need to cut and paste each function's
graph into its own separate file first.


=item B<ch>

Dump each function after copying loop headers.  The file name is made by
appending F<.ch> to the source file name.


=item B<ssa>

=item B<dce>

Dump each function after dead code elimination.  The file name is made by

made by appending F<.mudflap> to the source file name.


=item B<sra>

Dump each function after performing scalar replacement of aggregates.  The
file name is made by appending F<.sra> to the source file name.


=item B<sink>

Dump each function after performing code sinking.  The file name is made
by appending F<.sink> to the source file name.


=item B<dom>

Dump each function after applying dominator tree optimizations.  The file

=item B<vrp>

Dump each function after Value Range Propagation (VRP).  The file name
is made by appending F<.vrp> to the source file name.


=item B<all>

Enable all the available tree dumps with the flags provided in this option.

=back



=item B<-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=>I<n>

This option controls the amount of debugging output the vectorizer prints.
This information is written to standard error, unless
B<-fdump-tree-all> or B<-fdump-tree-vect> is specified,
in which case it is output to the usual dump listing file, F<.vect>.
For I<n>=0 no diagnostic information is reported.
If I<n>=1 the vectorizer reports each loop that got vectorized,
and the total number of loops that got vectorized.
If I<n>=2 the vectorizer also reports non-vectorized loops that passed
the first analysis phase (vect_analyze_loop_form) - i.e. countable,
inner-most, single-bb, single-entry/exit loops.  This is the same verbosity
level that B<-fdump-tree-vect-stats> uses.
Higher verbosity levels mean either more information dumped for each
reported loop, or same amount of information reported for more loops:
if I<n>=3, vectorizer cost model information is reported.
If I<n>=4, alignment related information is added to the reports.
If I<n>=5, data-references related information (e.g. memory dependences,
memory access-patterns) is added to the reports.
If I<n>=6, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized inner-most loops
that did not pass the first analysis phase (i.e., may not be countable, or
may have complicated control-flow).
If I<n>=7, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized nested loops.
If I<n>=8, SLP related information is added to the reports.
For I<n>=9, all the information the vectorizer generates during its
analysis and transformation is reported.  This is the same verbosity level
that B<-fdump-tree-vect-details> uses.


=item B<-frandom-seed=>I<string>

This option provides a seed that GCC uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the B<-frandom-seed> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.

The I<string> should be different for every file you compile.


=item B<-fsched-verbose=>I<n>

On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless B<-fdump-rtl-sched1> or
B<-fdump-rtl-sched2> is specified, in which case it is output
to the usual dump listing file, F<.sched1> or F<.sched2>
respectively.  However for I<n> greater than nine, the output is
always printed to standard error.

For I<n> greater than zero, B<-fsched-verbose> outputs the
same information as B<-fdump-rtl-sched1> and B<-fdump-rtl-sched2>.
For I<n> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For I<n> greater
than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
And for I<n> over four, B<-fsched-verbose> also includes
dependence info.


=item B<-save-temps>


=item B<-save-temps=cwd>

Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling F<foo.c> with B<-c -save-temps> would produce files
F<foo.i> and F<foo.s>, as well as F<foo.o>.  This creates a
preprocessed F<foo.i> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

When used in combination with the B<-x> command line option,
B<-save-temps> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using B<-save-temps>.

If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:

	
	gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
	gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&


may result in F<foo.i> and F<foo.o> being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.


=item B<-save-temps=obj>

Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently.  If the
B<-o> option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the B<-o> option is not used, the
B<-save-temps=obj> switch behaves like B<-save-temps>.

For example:

	
	gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
	gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
	gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar


would create F<foo.i>, F<foo.s>, F<dir/xbar.i>,
F<dir/xbar.s>, F<dir2/yfoobar.i>, F<dir2/yfoobar.s>, and
F<dir2/yfoobar.o>.


=item B<-time>[B<=>I<file>]

Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).

Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:

	
	# cc1 0.12 0.01
	# as 0.00 0.01


The first number on each line is the "user time", that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is "system time",
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.

With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:

	
	0.12 0.01 cc1 <options>
	0.00 0.01 as <options>


The "user time" and the "system time" are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one
can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.


=item B<-fvar-tracking>

Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).

It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (B<-Os>,
B<-O>, B<-O2>, ...), debugging information (B<-g>) and
the debug info format supports it.


=item B<-fvar-tracking-assignments>

Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the
way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while
optimizing.  Use of B<-gdwarf-4> is recommended along with it.

It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
annotations will be created and maintained, but discarded at the end.


=item B<-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle>

Toggle B<-fvar-tracking-assignments>, in the same way that
B<-gtoggle> toggles B<-g>.


=item B<-print-file-name=>I<library>

Print the full absolute name of the library file I<library> that
would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.


=item B<-print-multi-directory>

Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX>.


=item B<-print-multi-lib>

Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
B<;>, and each switch starts with an B<@> instead of the
B<->, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell-processing.


=item B<-print-multi-os-directory>

Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some F<lib> subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
present in the F<lib> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just F<.>, if OS libraries are present in F<libI<suffix>>
sibling directories this prints e.g. F<../lib64>, F<../lib> or
F<../lib32>, or if OS libraries are present in F<lib/I<subdir>>
subdirectories it prints e.g. F<amd64>, F<sparcv9> or F<ev6>.


=item B<-print-prog-name=>I<program>

Like B<-print-file-name>, but searches for a program such as B<cpp>.


=item B<-print-libgcc-file-name>

Same as B<-print-file-name=libgcc.a>.

This is useful when you use B<-nostdlib> or B<-nodefaultlibs>
but you do want to link with F<libgcc.a>.  You can do

	
	gcc -nostdlib <files>... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`



=item B<-print-search-dirs>

Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories B<gcc> will search---and don't do anything else.

This is useful when B<gcc> prints the error message
B<installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory>.
To resolve this you either need to put F<cpp0> and the other compiler
components where B<gcc> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX> to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing B</>.



=item B<-print-sysroot>

Print the target sysroot directory that will be used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the B<--sysroot> option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.


=item B<-print-sysroot-headers-suffix>

Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix---and don't do anything else.


=item B<-dumpmachine>

Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
B<i686-pc-linux-gnu>)---and don't do anything else.


=item B<-dumpversion>

Print the compiler version (for example, B<3.0>)---and don't do
anything else.


=item B<-dumpspecs>

Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when GCC itself is being built.)  


=item B<-feliminate-unused-debug-types>

Normally, when producing DWARF2 output, GCC will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, GCC will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.

=back



=head2 Options That Control Optimization


These options control various sorts of optimizations.

Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.

Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

Most optimizations are only enabled if an B<-O> level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual             
optimization flags are specified.

Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each B<-O> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with B<-Q --help=optimizers>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.



=over 4


=item B<-O>


=item B<-O1>

Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

With B<-O>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

B<-O> turns on the following optimization flags:

B<-fauto-inc-dec 
-fcompare-elim 
-fcprop-registers 
-fdce 
-fdefer-pop 
-fdelayed-branch 
-fdse 
-fguess-branch-probability 
-fif-conversion2 
-fif-conversion 
-fipa-pure-const 
-fipa-profile 
-fipa-reference 
-fmerge-constants
-fsplit-wide-types 
-ftree-bit-ccp 
-ftree-builtin-call-dce 
-ftree-ccp 
-ftree-ch 
-ftree-copyrename 
-ftree-dce 
-ftree-dominator-opts 
-ftree-dse 
-ftree-forwprop 
-ftree-fre 
-ftree-phiprop 
-ftree-sra 
-ftree-pta 
-ftree-ter 
-funit-at-a-time>

B<-O> also turns on B<-fomit-frame-pointer> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.


=item B<-O2>

Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to B<-O>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

B<-O2> turns on all optimization flags specified by B<-O>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
B<-fthread-jumps 
-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
-falign-loops  -falign-labels 
-fcaller-saves 
-fcrossjumping 
-fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
-fdevirtualize 
-fexpensive-optimizations 
-fgcse  -fgcse-lm  
-finline-small-functions 
-findirect-inlining 
-fipa-sra 
-foptimize-sibling-calls 
-fpartial-inlining 
-fpeephole2 
-fregmove 
-freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
-frerun-cse-after-loop  
-fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec 
-fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 
-fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow 
-ftree-switch-conversion 
-ftree-pre 
-ftree-vrp>

Please note the warning under B<-fgcse> about
invoking B<-O2> on programs that use computed gotos.


=item B<-O3>

Optimize yet more.  B<-O3> turns on all optimizations specified
by B<-O2> and also turns on the B<-finline-functions>,
B<-funswitch-loops>, B<-fpredictive-commoning>,
B<-fgcse-after-reload>, B<-ftree-vectorize> and
B<-fipa-cp-clone> options.


=item B<-O0>

Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.


=item B<-Os>

Optimize for size.  B<-Os> enables all B<-O2> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.

B<-Os> disables the following optimization flags:
B<-falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
-falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition 
-fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version>


=item B<-Ofast>

Disregard strict standards compliance.  B<-Ofast> enables all
B<-O3> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard compliant programs.
It turns on B<-ffast-math>.

If you use multiple B<-O> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.

=back


Options of the form B<-f>I<flag> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of B<-ffoo> would be B<-fno-foo>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing B<no->
or adding it.

The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by B<-O> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.


=over 4


=item B<-fno-default-inline>

Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
S<B<-O>>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add B<inline> in front of
the member function name.


=item B<-fno-defer-pop>

Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.

Disabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fforward-propagate>

Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.

This option is enabled by default at optimization levels B<-O>,
B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-ffp-contract=>I<style>

B<-ffp-contract=off> disables floating-point expression contraction.
B<-ffp-contract=fast> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
B<-ffp-contract=on> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to B<-ffp-contract=off>.

The default is B<-ffp-contract=fast>.


=item B<-fomit-frame-pointer>

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  B<It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.>

On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro C<FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  

Starting with GCC version 4.6, the default setting (when not optimizing for
size) for 32-bit Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets has been changed to
B<-fomit-frame-pointer>.  The default can be reverted to
B<-fno-omit-frame-pointer> by configuring GCC with the
B<--enable-frame-pointer> configure option.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-foptimize-sibling-calls>

Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fno-inline>

Don't pay attention to the C<inline> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.


=item B<-finline-small-functions>

Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.

Enabled at level B<-O2>.


=item B<-findirect-inlining>

Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the B<-finline-functions>
or B<-finline-small-functions> options.

Enabled at level B<-O2>.


=item B<-finline-functions>

Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.

If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared C<static>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

Enabled at level B<-O3>.


=item B<-finline-functions-called-once>

Consider all C<static> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked C<inline>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.

Enabled at levels B<-O1>, B<-O2>, B<-O3> and B<-Os>.


=item B<-fearly-inlining>

Inline functions marked by C<always_inline> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
B<-fprofile-generate> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.

Enabled by default.


=item B<-fipa-sra>

Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3> and B<-Os>.


=item B<-finline-limit=>I<n>

By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  I<n> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.

Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using B<--param> I<name>B<=>I<value>.
The B<-finline-limit=>I<n> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:


=over 4


=item B<max-inline-insns-single>

is set to I<n>/2.

=item B<max-inline-insns-auto>

is set to I<n>/2.

=back


See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.

I<Note:> there may be no value to B<-finline-limit> that results
in default behavior.

I<Note:> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.


=item B<-fno-keep-inline-dllexport>

This is a more fine-grained version of B<-fkeep-inline-functions>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the C<dllexport>
attribute or declspec 


=item B<-fkeep-inline-functions>

In C, emit C<static> functions that are declared C<inline>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
C<extern inline> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.


=item B<-fkeep-static-consts>

Emit variables declared C<static const> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the B<-fno-keep-static-consts> option.


=item B<-fmerge-constants>

Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point
constants) across compilation units.

This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use B<-fno-merge-constants> to inhibit this
behavior.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fmerge-all-constants>

Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

This option implies B<-fmerge-constants>.  In addition to
B<-fmerge-constants> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.


=item B<-fmodulo-sched>

Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.


=item B<-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves>

Perform more aggressive SMS based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges will be
deleted which will trigger the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
B<-fmodulo-sched> enabled.


=item B<-fno-branch-count-reg>

Do not use "decrement and branch" instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result.
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390.

The default is B<-fbranch-count-reg>.


=item B<-fno-function-cse>

Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.

This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.

The default is B<-ffunction-cse>


=item B<-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss>

If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save space in the resulting
code.

This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.

The default is B<-fzero-initialized-in-bss>.


=item B<-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir>

For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (F<libmudflap>), which will be linked into a program if
B<-fmudflap> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the B<MUDFLAP_OPTIONS>
environment variable.  See C<env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out>
for its options.

Use B<-fmudflapth> instead of B<-fmudflap> to compile and to
link if your program is multi-threaded.  Use B<-fmudflapir>, in
addition to B<-fmudflap> or B<-fmudflapth>, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows
erroneously read data to propagate within a program.


=item B<-fthread-jumps>

Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fsplit-wide-types>

When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as C<long
long> on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>,
B<-Os>.


=item B<-fcse-follow-jumps>

In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when CSE encounters an C<if> statement with an
C<else> clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fcse-skip-blocks>

This is similar to B<-fcse-follow-jumps>, but causes CSE to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
encounters a simple C<if> statement with no else clause,
B<-fcse-skip-blocks> causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the C<if>.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-frerun-cse-after-loop>

Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
performed.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fgcse>

Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.

I<Note:> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
extension, you may get better runtime performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
B<-fno-gcse> to the command line.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fgcse-lm>

When B<-fgcse-lm> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination will
attempt to move loads which are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.

Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.


=item B<-fgcse-sm>

When B<-fgcse-sm> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass will attempt to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with B<-fgcse-lm>,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.

Not enabled at any optimization level.


=item B<-fgcse-las>

When B<-fgcse-las> is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).

Not enabled at any optimization level.


=item B<-fgcse-after-reload>

When B<-fgcse-after-reload> is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to cleanup
redundant spilling.


=item B<-funsafe-loop-optimizations>

If given, the loop optimizer will assume that loop indices do not
overflow, and that the loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are valid.
Using B<-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations>, the compiler will warn you
if it finds this kind of loop.


=item B<-fcrossjumping>

Perform cross-jumping transformation.  This transformation unifies equivalent code and save code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fauto-inc-dec>

Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at B<-O> and
higher on architectures that support this.


=item B<-fdce>

Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL.
Enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-fdse>

Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL.
Enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-fif-conversion>

Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
include use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by C<if-conversion2>.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fif-conversion2>

Use conditional execution (where available) to transform conditional jumps into
branch-less equivalents.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fdelete-null-pointer-checks>

Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.

Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use B<-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks> to disable this optimization
for programs which depend on that behavior.

Some targets, especially embedded ones, disable this option at all levels.
Otherwise it is enabled at all levels: B<-O0>, B<-O1>,
B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.  Passes that use the information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.


=item B<-fdevirtualize>

Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (C<-findirect-inlining>) and interprocedural constant
propagation (B<-fipa-cp>).
Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fexpensive-optimizations>

Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-foptimize-register-move>


=item B<-fregmove>

Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as
operands of other simple instructions in order to maximize the amount of
register tying.  This is especially helpful on machines with two-operand
instructions.

Note B<-fregmove> and B<-foptimize-register-move> are the same
optimization.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fira-algorithm=>I<algorithm>

Use specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The I<algorithm> argument should be C<priority> or
C<CB>.  The first algorithm specifies Chow's priority coloring,
the second one specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  The second
algorithm can be unimplemented for some architectures.  If it is
implemented, it is the default because Chaitin-Briggs coloring as a
rule generates a better code.


=item B<-fira-region=>I<region>

Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
I<region> argument should be one of C<all>, C<mixed>, or
C<one>.  The first value means using all loops as register
allocation regions, the second value which is the default means using
all loops except for loops with small register pressure as the
regions, and third one means using all function as a single region.
The first value can give best result for machines with small size and
irregular register set, the third one results in faster and generates
decent code and the smallest size code, and the default value usually
give the best results in most cases and for most architectures.


=item B<-fira-loop-pressure>

Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decision to move
loop invariants.  Usage of this option usually results in generation
of faster and smaller code on machines with big register files (E<gt>= 32
registers) but it can slow compiler down.

This option is enabled at level B<-O3> for some targets.


=item B<-fno-ira-share-save-slots>

Switch off sharing stack slots used for saving call used hard
registers living through a call.  Each hard register will get a
separate stack slot and as a result function stack frame will be
bigger.


=item B<-fno-ira-share-spill-slots>

Switch off sharing stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each
pseudo-register which did not get a hard register will get a separate
stack slot and as a result function stack frame will be bigger.


=item B<-fira-verbose=>I<n>

Set up how verbose dump file for the integrated register allocator
will be.  Default value is 5.  If the value is greater or equal to 10,
the dump file will be stderr as if the value were I<n> minus 10.


=item B<-fdelayed-branch>

If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
instructions.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fschedule-insns>

If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating point instruction is required.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>.


=item B<-fschedule-insns2>

Similar to B<-fschedule-insns>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fno-sched-interblock>

Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally
enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
with B<-fschedule-insns> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fno-sched-spec>

Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is normally
enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
with B<-fschedule-insns> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-pressure>

Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before the register
allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation is enabled, i.e. with B<-fschedule-insns> or at
B<-O2> or higher.  Usage of this option can improve the
generated code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure
increase above the number of available hard registers and as a
consequence register spills in the register allocation.


=item B<-fsched-spec-load>

Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only makes
sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
B<-fschedule-insns> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-spec-load-dangerous>

Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only makes
sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
B<-fschedule-insns> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-stalled-insns>


=item B<-fsched-stalled-insns=>I<n>

Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the queue
of stalled insns into the ready list, during the second scheduling pass.
B<-fno-sched-stalled-insns> means that no insns will be moved
prematurely, B<-fsched-stalled-insns=0> means there is no limit
on how many queued insns can be moved prematurely.
B<-fsched-stalled-insns> without a value is equivalent to
B<-fsched-stalled-insns=1>.


=item B<-fsched-stalled-insns-dep>


=item B<-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=>I<n>

Define how many insn groups (cycles) will be examined for a dependency
on a stalled insn that is candidate for premature removal from the queue
of stalled insns.  This has an effect only during the second scheduling pass,
and only if B<-fsched-stalled-insns> is used.
B<-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep> is equivalent to
B<-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0>.
B<-fsched-stalled-insns-dep> without a value is equivalent to
B<-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1>.


=item B<-fsched2-use-superblocks>

When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock scheduling
algorithm.  Superblock scheduling allows motion across basic block boundaries
resulting on faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by GCC model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.

This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
B<-fschedule-insns2> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-group-heuristic>

Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors 
the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.  This is enabled 
by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with B<-fschedule-insns> 
or B<-fschedule-insns2> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-critical-path-heuristic>

Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors 
instructions on the critical path.  This is enabled by default when 
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with B<-fschedule-insns> 
or B<-fschedule-insns2> or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic>

Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This 
heuristic favors speculative instructions with greater dependency weakness.  
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. 
with B<-fschedule-insns> or B<-fschedule-insns2> 
or at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-rank-heuristic>

Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors 
the instruction belonging to a basic block with greater size or frequency.  
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. 
with B<-fschedule-insns> or B<-fschedule-insns2> or 
at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-last-insn-heuristic>

Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic 
favors the instruction that is less dependent on the last instruction
scheduled.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, 
i.e. with B<-fschedule-insns> or B<-fschedule-insns2> or 
at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-fsched-dep-count-heuristic>

Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic 
favors the instruction that has more instructions depending on it.  
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. 
with B<-fschedule-insns> or B<-fschedule-insns2> or 
at B<-O2> or higher.


=item B<-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops>

The modulo scheduling comes before the traditional scheduling, if a loop
was modulo scheduled we may want to prevent the later scheduling passes
from changing its schedule, we use this option to control that.


=item B<-fselective-scheduling>

Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective
scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler pass.


=item B<-fselective-scheduling2>

Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective
scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler pass.


=item B<-fsel-sched-pipelining>

Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective scheduling.
This option has no effect until one of B<-fselective-scheduling> or
B<-fselective-scheduling2> is turned on.


=item B<-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops>

When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also pipeline outer loops.
This option has no effect until B<-fsel-sched-pipelining> is turned on.


=item B<-fcaller-saves>

Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.

This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fcombine-stack-adjustments>

Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references
and then tries to find ways to combine them.

Enabled by default at B<-O1> and higher.


=item B<-fconserve-stack>

Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler will attempt to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the B<large-stack-frame> parameter to 100
and the B<large-stack-frame-growth> parameter to 400.


=item B<-ftree-reassoc>

Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-pre>

Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at B<-O2> and B<-O3>.


=item B<-ftree-forwprop>

Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-fre>

Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-phiprop>

Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
pass is enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-copy-prop>

Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at B<-O> and
higher.


=item B<-fipa-pure-const>

Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-fipa-reference>

Discover which static variables do not escape cannot escape the
compilation unit.
Enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-fipa-struct-reorg>

Perform structure reorganization optimization, that change C-like structures
layout in order to better utilize spatial locality.  This transformation is
affective for programs containing arrays of structures.  Available in two
compilation modes: profile-based (enabled with B<-fprofile-generate>)
or static (which uses built-in heuristics).  It works only in whole program
mode, so it requires B<-fwhole-program> to be
enabled.  Structures considered B<cold> by this transformation are not
affected (see B<--param struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio=>I<value>).

With this flag, the program debug info reflects a new structure layout.


=item B<-fipa-pta>

Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.


=item B<-fipa-profile>

Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
C<cold>, C<noreturn>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-fipa-cp>

Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at B<-O2>, B<-Os> and B<-O3>.


=item B<-fipa-cp-clone>

Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation will perform function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see B<--param ipcp-unit-growth=>I<value>).
This flag is enabled by default at B<-O3>.


=item B<-fipa-matrix-reorg>

Perform matrix flattening and transposing.
Matrix flattening tries to replace an m-dimensional matrix
with its equivalent n-dimensional matrix, where n E<lt> m.
This reduces the level of indirection needed for accessing the elements
of the matrix. The second optimization is matrix transposing that
attempts to change the order of the matrix's dimensions in order to
improve cache locality.
Both optimizations need the B<-fwhole-program> flag.
Transposing is enabled only if profiling information is available.


=item B<-ftree-sink>

Perform forward store motion  on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-bit-ccp>

Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate
pointer alignment information.
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at B<-O> and higher.  It requires that B<-ftree-ccp> is enabled.


=item B<-ftree-ccp>

Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on trees.  This
pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-switch-conversion>

Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by default
at B<-O2> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-dce>

Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by
default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-builtin-call-dce>

Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to builtin functions
that may set C<errno> but are otherwise side-effect free.  This flag is
enabled by default at B<-O2> and higher if B<-Os> is not also
specified.


=item B<-ftree-dominator-opts>

Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-dse>

Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location which will later be overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-ch>

Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.  It is not enabled
for B<-Os>, since it usually increases code size.


=item B<-ftree-loop-optimize>

Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-loop-linear>

Perform loop interchange transformations on tree.  Same as
B<-floop-interchange>.  To use this code transformation, GCC has
to be configured with B<--with-ppl> and B<--with-cloog> to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.


=item B<-floop-interchange>

Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a
loop like:
	
	DO J = 1, M
	  DO I = 1, N
	    A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
	  ENDDO
	ENDDO

loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user had written:
	
	DO I = 1, N
	  DO J = 1, M
	    A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
	  ENDDO
	ENDDO

which can be beneficial when C<N> is larger than the caches,
because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization
applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is not limited to
Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured
with B<--with-ppl> and B<--with-cloog> to enable the
Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.


=item B<-floop-strip-mine>

Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
using the B<loop-block-tile-size> parameter.  For example,
given a loop like:
	
	DO I = 1, N
	  A(I) = A(I) + C
	ENDDO

loop strip mining will transform the loop as if the user had written:
	
	DO II = 1, N, 51
	  DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
	    A(I) = A(I) + C
	  ENDDO
	ENDDO

This optimization applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is
not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to
be configured with B<--with-ppl> and B<--with-cloog> to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.


=item B<-floop-block>

Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the
element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be changed
using the B<loop-block-tile-size> parameter.  For example, given
a loop like:
	
	DO I = 1, N
	  DO J = 1, M
	    A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
	  ENDDO
	ENDDO

loop blocking will transform the loop as if the user had written:
	
	DO II = 1, N, 51
	  DO JJ = 1, M, 51
	    DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
	      DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
	        A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
	      ENDDO
	    ENDDO
	  ENDDO
	ENDDO

which can be beneficial when C<M> is larger than the caches,
because the innermost loop will iterate over a smaller amount of data
that can be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to all the
languages supported by GCC and is not limited to Fortran.  To use this
code transformation, GCC has to be configured with B<--with-ppl>
and B<--with-cloog> to enable the Graphite loop transformation
infrastructure.


=item B<-fgraphite-identity>

Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
B<-fgraphite-identity> we can check the costs or benefits of the
GIMPLE -E<gt> GRAPHITE -E<gt> GIMPLE transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator CLooG, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.


=item B<-floop-flatten>

Removes the loop nesting structure: transforms the loop nest into a
single loop.  This transformation can be useful to vectorize all the
levels of the loop nest.


=item B<-floop-parallelize-all>

Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can
be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be analyzed to
not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it is
profitable to parallelize the loops.


=item B<-fcheck-data-deps>

Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.  This option
is used for debugging the data dependence analyzers.


=item B<-ftree-loop-if-convert>

Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.


=item B<-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores>

Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory writes.
This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded programs as it
transforms conditional memory writes into unconditional memory writes.
For example,
	
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
	  if (cond)
	    A[i] = expr;

would be transformed to
	
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
	  A[i] = cond ? expr : A[i];

potentially producing data races.


=item B<-ftree-loop-distribution>

Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop
	
	DO I = 1, N
	  A(I) = B(I) + C
	  D(I) = E(I) * F
	ENDDO

is transformed to
	
	DO I = 1, N
	   A(I) = B(I) + C
	ENDDO
	DO I = 1, N
	   D(I) = E(I) * F
	ENDDO



=item B<-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns>

Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at B<-O3>.

This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop
	
	DO I = 1, N
	  A(I) = 0
	  B(I) = A(I) + I
	ENDDO

is transformed to
	
	DO I = 1, N
	   A(I) = 0
	ENDDO
	DO I = 1, N
	   B(I) = A(I) + I
	ENDDO

and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset zero.


=item B<-ftree-loop-im>

Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With B<-funswitch-loops> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.


=item B<-ftree-loop-ivcanon>

Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop for that
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.


=item B<-fivopts>

Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.


=item B<-ftree-parallelize-loops=n>

Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies B<-pthread>, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for B<-pthread>.


=item B<-ftree-pta>

Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-sra>

Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-copyrename>

Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-ter>

Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-E<gt>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is
enabled by default at B<-O> and higher.


=item B<-ftree-vectorize>

Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
B<-O3>.


=item B<-ftree-slp-vectorize>

Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
B<-O3> and when B<-ftree-vectorize> is enabled.


=item B<-ftree-vect-loop-version>

Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with runtime checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default
except at level B<-Os> where it is disabled.


=item B<-fvect-cost-model>

Enable cost model for vectorization.


=item B<-ftree-vrp>

Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at B<-O2> and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if B<-fdelete-null-pointer-checks> is
enabled.


=item B<-ftracer>

Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.


=item B<-funroll-loops>

Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  B<-funroll-loops> implies
B<-frerun-cse-after-loop>.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.


=item B<-funroll-all-loops>

Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
B<-funroll-all-loops> implies the same options as
B<-funroll-loops>,


=item B<-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller>

Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.

Combination of B<-fweb> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated than
a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not work at all
on some of the architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.

This optimization is enabled by default.


=item B<-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller>

With this option, the compiler will create multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop which can result in superior code.


=item B<-fpartial-inlining>

Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the B<-finline-functions>
or B<-finline-small-functions> options.

Enabled at level B<-O2>.


=item B<-fpredictive-commoning>

Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing computations
(especially memory loads and stores) performed in previous
iterations of loops.

This option is enabled at level B<-O3>.


=item B<-fprefetch-loop-arrays>

If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

This option may generate better or worse code; results are highly
dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.

Disabled at level B<-Os>.


=item B<-fno-peephole>


=item B<-fno-peephole2>

Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference
between B<-fno-peephole> and B<-fno-peephole2> is in how they
are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
other, a few use both.

B<-fpeephole> is enabled by default.
B<-fpeephole2> enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fno-guess-branch-probability>

Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

GCC will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (B<-fprofile-arcs>).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by B<__builtin_expect>, then the heuristics will be
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the B<__builtin_expect> info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and B<__builtin_expect> can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of B<__builtin_expect> are easier to understand.

The default is B<-fguess-branch-probability> at levels
B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-freorder-blocks>

Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of
taken branches and improve code locality.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>.


=item B<-freorder-blocks-and-partition>

In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.

This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.


=item B<-freorder-functions>

Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections C<.text.hot> for most frequently executed functions and
C<.text.unlikely> for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.

Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option effective.  See
B<-fprofile-arcs> for details.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fstrict-aliasing>

Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an C<unsigned int> can alias an C<int>, but not a
C<void*> or a C<double>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

Pay special attention to code like this:
	
	union a_union {
	  int i;
	  double d;
	};
	
	int f() {
	  union a_union t;
	  t.d = 3.0;
	  return t.i;
	}

The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even with
B<-fstrict-aliasing>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.    However, this code might not:
	
	int f() {
	  union a_union t;
	  int* ip;
	  t.d = 3.0;
	  ip = &t.i;
	  return *ip;
	}


Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
	
	int f() {
	  double d = 3.0;
	  return ((union a_union *) &d)->i;
	}


The B<-fstrict-aliasing> option is enabled at levels
B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fstrict-overflow>

Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like C<i + 10 E<gt> i> will always be true for
signed C<i>.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if C<i + 10> overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.

This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that C<p + u E<gt>
p> is always true for a pointer C<p> and unsigned integer
C<u>.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if C<p + u> overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.

See also the B<-fwrapv> option.  Using B<-fwrapv> means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
B<-fwrapv> is used, there is no difference between
B<-fstrict-overflow> and B<-fno-strict-overflow> for
integers.  With B<-fwrapv> certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
B<-fwrapv>, but not otherwise.

The B<-fstrict-overflow> option is enabled at levels
B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-falign-functions>


=item B<-falign-functions=>I<n>

Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than
I<n>, skipping up to I<n> bytes.  For instance,
B<-falign-functions=32> aligns functions to the next 32-byte
boundary, but B<-falign-functions=24> would align to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less.

B<-fno-align-functions> and B<-falign-functions=1> are
equivalent and mean that functions will not be aligned.

Some assemblers only support this flag when I<n> is a power of two;
in that case, it is rounded up.

If I<n> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>.


=item B<-falign-labels>


=item B<-falign-labels=>I<n>

Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to
I<n> bytes like B<-falign-functions>.  This option can easily
make code slower, because it must insert dummy operations for when the
branch target is reached in the usual flow of the code.

B<-fno-align-labels> and B<-falign-labels=1> are
equivalent and mean that labels will not be aligned.

If B<-falign-loops> or B<-falign-jumps> are applicable and
are greater than this value, then their values are used instead.

If I<n> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default
which is very likely to be B<1>, meaning no alignment.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>.


=item B<-falign-loops>


=item B<-falign-loops=>I<n>

Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to I<n> bytes
like B<-falign-functions>.  The hope is that the loop will be
executed many times, which will make up for any execution of the dummy
operations.

B<-fno-align-loops> and B<-falign-loops=1> are
equivalent and mean that loops will not be aligned.

If I<n> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>.


=item B<-falign-jumps>


=item B<-falign-jumps=>I<n>

Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch targets
where the targets can only be reached by jumping, skipping up to I<n>
bytes like B<-falign-functions>.  In this case, no dummy operations
need be executed.

B<-fno-align-jumps> and B<-falign-jumps=1> are
equivalent and mean that loops will not be aligned.

If I<n> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

Enabled at levels B<-O2>, B<-O3>.


=item B<-funit-at-a-time>

This option is left for compatibility reasons. B<-funit-at-a-time>
has no effect, while B<-fno-unit-at-a-time> implies
B<-fno-toplevel-reorder> and B<-fno-section-anchors>.

Enabled by default.


=item B<-fno-toplevel-reorder>

Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and C<asm>
statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
will not be removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
which relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes.

Enabled at level B<-O0>.  When disabled explicitly, it also imply
B<-fno-section-anchors> that is otherwise enabled at B<-O0> on some
targets.


=item B<-fweb>

Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
"home register".

Enabled by default with B<-funroll-loops>.


=item B<-fwhole-program>

Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of C<main>
and those merged by attribute C<externally_visible> become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers. If B<gold> is used as the linker plugin, C<externally_visible> attributes are automatically added to functions (not variable yet due to a current B<gold> issue) that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to resolution file produced by B<gold>.  For other linkers that cannot generate resolution file, explicit C<externally_visible> attributes are still necessary.
While this option is equivalent to proper use of the C<static> keyword for
programs consisting of a single file, in combination with option
B<-flto> this flag can be used to
compile many smaller scale programs since the functions and variables become
local for the whole combined compilation unit, not for the single source file
itself.

This option implies B<-fwhole-file> for Fortran programs.


=item B<-flto[=>I<n>B<]>

This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.

To use the link-timer optimizer, B<-flto> needs to be specified at
compile time and during the final link.  For example,

	
	gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
	gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
	gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o


The first two invocations to GCC will save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside F<foo.o> and
F<bar.o>.  The final invocation will read the GIMPLE bytecode from
F<foo.o> and F<bar.o>, merge the two files into a single
internal image, and compile the result as usual.  Since both
F<foo.o> and F<bar.o> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the inter-procedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner will be able to inline functions in
F<bar.o> into functions in F<foo.o> and vice-versa.

Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is,

	
	gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c


The above will generate bytecode for F<foo.c> and F<bar.c>,
merge them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimize
them as usual to produce F<myprog>.

The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations the B<-flto> flag needs to be passed to both the
compile and the link commands.

To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see B<-fuse-linker-plugin>) passes to the
compiler information about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, B<-fwhole-program> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which will lead
to more aggressive optimization decisions.

Note that when a file is compiled with B<-flto>, the generated
object file will be larger than a regular object file because it will
contain GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as a normal object
file.  So, in the previous example, if the final link is done with

	
	gcc -o myprog foo.o bar.o


The only difference will be that no inter-procedural optimizations
will be applied to produce F<myprog>.  The two object files
F<foo.o> and F<bar.o> will be simply sent to the regular
linker.

Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link-time.  For instance,

	
	gcc -c -O0 -flto foo.c
	gcc -c -O0 -flto bar.c
	gcc -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o


This will produce individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary F<myprog> will be optimized at
B<-O3>.  Now, if the final binary is generated without
B<-flto>, then F<myprog> will not be optimized.

When producing the final binary with B<-flto>, GCC will only
apply link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC will automatically select
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.

There are some code generation flags that GCC will preserve when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Currently, the following options are saved into the GIMPLE
bytecode files: B<-fPIC>, B<-fcommon> and all the
B<-m> target flags.

At link time, these options are read-in and reapplied.  Note that the
current implementation makes no attempt at recognizing conflicting
values for these options.  If two or more files have a conflicting
value (e.g., one file is compiled with B<-fPIC> and another
isn't), the compiler will simply use the last value read from the
bytecode files.  It is recommended, then, that all the files
participating in the same link be compiled with the same options.

Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages.  This requires
some support in the language front end.  Currently, the C, C++ and
Fortran front ends are capable of emitting GIMPLE bytecodes, so
something like this should work

	
	gcc -c -flto foo.c
	g++ -c -flto bar.cc
	gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
	g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran


Notice that the final link is done with B<g++> to get the C++
runtime libraries and B<-lgfortran> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command used when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.  This means that if your build process
was mixing languages before, all you need to add is B<-flto> to
all the compile and link commands.

If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at runtime.

If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
F<libfoo.a>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with linker plugin support.  To enable this feature, use
the flag B<-fuse-linker-plugin> at link-time:

	
	gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo


With the linker plugin enabled, the linker will extract the needed
GIMPLE files from F<libfoo.a> and pass them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.

If you are not using a linker with linker plugin support and/or do not 
enable linker plugin then the objects inside F<libfoo.a>
will be extracted and linked as usual, but they will not participate
in the LTO optimization process.

Link time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine B<-flto> and with B<-fwhole-program> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities. 
Use of B<-fwhole-program> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see B<-fuse-linker-plugin>).

Regarding portability: the current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt at generating bytecode that can be ported between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC will not work with an older/newer version of GCC.

Link time optimization does not play well with generating debugging
information.  Combining B<-flto> with
B<-g> is currently experimental and expected to produce wrong
results.

If you specify the optional I<n>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using I<n>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed B<make> program.  The
environment variable B<MAKE> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for I<n> is 1.

You can also specify B<-flto=jobserver> to use GNU make's 
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This 
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.
The parent Makefile will need a B<+> prepended to the command recipe
for this to work. This will likely only work if B<MAKE> is 
GNU make.

This option is disabled by default.


=item B<-flto-partition=>I<alg>

Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link time optimizer.
The value is either C<1to1> to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or C<balanced> to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible).  Specifying C<none>
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. The
default value is C<balanced>.


=item B<-flto-compression-level=>I<n>

This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to LTO object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with LTO mode (B<-flto>).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.


=item B<-flto-report>

Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time
optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version to version,
it is meant to be useful to GCC developers when processing object
files in LTO mode (via B<-flto>).

Disabled by default.


=item B<-fuse-linker-plugin>

Enables the use of linker plugin during link time optimization.  This option
relies on the linker plugin support in linker that is available in gold
or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.

This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out of
library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing more
code the the link time optimizer.  This information specify what symbols 
can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic linking).
Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared libraries that do
use hidden visibility) is similar to C<-fwhole-program>.  See
B<-flto> for a description on the effect of this flag and how to use it.

Enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was compiled
with a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).


=item B<-fcompare-elim>

After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting,
identify arithmetic instructions that compute processor flags similar to a
comparison operation based on that arithmetic.  If possible, eliminate the
explicit comparison operation.

This pass only applies to certain targets that cannot explicitly represent
the comparison operation before register allocation is complete.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fcprop-registers>

After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting,
we perform a copy-propagation pass to try to reduce scheduling dependencies
and occasionally eliminate the copy.

Enabled at levels B<-O>, B<-O2>, B<-O3>, B<-Os>.


=item B<-fprofile-correction>

Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may
be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option is specified,
GCC will use heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, GCC will emit an error message when an inconsistent profile is detected.


=item B<-fprofile-dir=>I<path>


Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to I<path>.
This option affects only the profile data generated by
B<-fprofile-generate>, B<-ftest-coverage>, B<-fprofile-arcs>
and used by B<-fprofile-use> and B<-fbranch-probabilities>
and its related options.
By default, GCC will use the current directory as I<path>, thus the
profile data file will appear in the same directory as the object file.


=item B<-fprofile-generate>


=item B<-fprofile-generate=>I<path>


Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based
optimization.  You must use B<-fprofile-generate> both when
compiling and when linking your program.

The following options are enabled: C<-fprofile-arcs>, C<-fprofile-values>, C<-fvpt>.

If I<path> is specified, GCC will look at the I<path> to find
the profile feedback data files. See B<-fprofile-dir>.


=item B<-fprofile-use>


=item B<-fprofile-use=>I<path>

Enable profile feedback directed optimizations, and optimizations
generally profitable only with profile feedback available.

The following options are enabled: C<-fbranch-probabilities>, C<-fvpt>,
C<-funroll-loops>, C<-fpeel-loops>, C<-ftracer>

By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not
match the source code.  This error can be turned into a warning by using
B<-Wcoverage-mismatch>.  Note this may result in poorly optimized
code.

If I<path> is specified, GCC will look at the I<path> to find
the profile feedback data files. See B<-fprofile-dir>.

=back


The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating
point arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.


=over 4


=item B<-ffloat-store>

Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.

This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a C<double> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use B<-ffloat-store> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.


=item B<-fexcess-precision=>I<style>

This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point registers have more precision than the IEEE
C<float> and C<double> types and the processor does not
support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
B<-fexcess-precision=fast> is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
B<-fexcess-precision=standard> is specified then excess
precision will follow the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas B<-ffloat-store> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as B<-std=c99> is used.

B<-fexcess-precision=standard> is not implemented for languages
other than C, and has no effect if
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> or B<-ffast-math> is
specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if B<-mfpmath=sse>
or B<-mfpmath=sse+387> is specified; in the former case, IEEE
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.


=item B<-ffast-math>

Sets B<-fno-math-errno>, B<-funsafe-math-optimizations>,
B<-ffinite-math-only>, B<-fno-rounding-math>,
B<-fno-signaling-nans> and B<-fcx-limited-range>.

This option causes the preprocessor macro C<__FAST_MATH__> to be defined.

This option is not turned on by any B<-O> option besides
B<-Ofast> since it can result in incorrect output for programs
which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.


=item B<-fno-math-errno>

Do not set ERRNO after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt.  A program that relies on
IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

This option is not turned on by any B<-O> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

The default is B<-fmath-errno>.

On Darwin systems, the math library never sets C<errno>.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and B<-fno-math-errno> is the default.


=item B<-funsafe-math-optimizations>


Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate IEEE or
ANSI standards.  When used at link-time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other
similar optimizations.

This option is not turned on by any B<-O> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
Enables B<-fno-signed-zeros>, B<-fno-trapping-math>,
B<-fassociative-math> and B<-freciprocal-math>.

The default is B<-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations>.


=item B<-fassociative-math>


Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on a code which relies on rounding behavior like
C<(x + 2**52) - 2**52)>.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both B<-fno-signed-zeros> and
B<-fno-trapping-math> be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with B<-frounding-math>. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both B<-fno-signed-zeros> and
B<-fno-trapping-math> are in effect.

The default is B<-fno-associative-math>.


=item B<-freciprocal-math>


Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example C<x / y>
can be replaced with C<x * (1/y)> which is useful if C<(1/y)>
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

The default is B<-fno-reciprocal-math>.


=item B<-ffinite-math-only>

Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

This option is not turned on by any B<-O> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

The default is B<-fno-finite-math-only>.


=item B<-fno-signed-zeros>

Allow optimizations for floating point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with B<-ffinite-math-only>).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

The default is B<-fsigned-zeros>.


=item B<-fno-trapping-math>

Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that B<-fno-signaling-nans> be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on "non-stop" IEEE arithmetic, for example.

This option should never be turned on by any B<-O> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions.

The default is B<-ftrapping-math>.


=item B<-frounding-math>

Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating
point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.

The default is B<-fno-rounding-math>.

This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's C<FENV_ACCESS> pragma.  This command line option
will be used to specify the default state for C<FENV_ACCESS>.


=item B<-fsignaling-nans>

Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate user-visible
traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies B<-ftrapping-math>.

This option causes the preprocessor macro C<__SUPPORT_SNAN__> to
be defined.

The default is B<-fno-signaling-nans>.

This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.


=item B<-fsingle-precision-constant>

Treat floating point constant as single precision constant instead of
implicitly converting it to double precision constant.


=item B<-fcx-limited-range>

When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is C<NaN
+ I*NaN>, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.  The
default is B<-fno-cx-limited-range>, but is enabled by
B<-ffast-math>.

This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
C<CX_LIMITED_RANGE> pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies to
all languages.


=item B<-fcx-fortran-rules>

Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range
reduction is done as part of complex division, but there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is C<NaN
+ I*NaN>, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.

The default is B<-fno-cx-fortran-rules>.


=back


The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any B<-O> options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.


=over 4


=item B<-fbranch-probabilities>

After running a program compiled with B<-fprofile-arcs>, you can compile it a second time using
B<-fbranch-probabilities>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with B<-fprofile-arcs> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called F<I<sourcename>.gcda> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.

With B<-fbranch-probabilities>, GCC puts a
B<REG_BR_PROB> note on each B<JUMP_INSN> and B<CALL_INSN>.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in F<reorg.c>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the B<REG_BR_PROB> values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.


=item B<-fprofile-values>

If combined with B<-fprofile-arcs>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

With B<-fbranch-probabilities>, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations.

Enabled with B<-fprofile-generate> and B<-fprofile-use>.


=item B<-fvpt>

If combined with B<-fprofile-arcs>, it instructs the compiler to add
a code to gather information about values of expressions.

With B<-fbranch-probabilities>, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.


=item B<-frename-registers>

Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in
a "home register".

Enabled by default with B<-funroll-loops> and B<-fpeel-loops>.


=item B<-ftracer>

Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.

Enabled with B<-fprofile-use>.


=item B<-funroll-loops>

Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  B<-funroll-loops> implies
B<-frerun-cse-after-loop>, B<-fweb> and B<-frename-registers>.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.

Enabled with B<-fprofile-use>.


=item B<-funroll-all-loops>

Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
B<-funroll-all-loops> implies the same options as
B<-funroll-loops>.


=item B<-fpeel-loops>

Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).

Enabled with B<-fprofile-use>.


=item B<-fmove-loop-invariants>

Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.  Enabled
at level B<-O1>


=item B<-funswitch-loops>

Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates
of the loop on both branches (modified according to result of the condition).


=item B<-ffunction-sections>


=item B<-fdata-sections>

Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.

Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.

Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use C<gprof> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and B<-g>.


=item B<-fbranch-target-load-optimize>

Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.


=item B<-fbranch-target-load-optimize2>

Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.


=item B<-fbtr-bb-exclusive>

When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.


=item B<-fstack-protector>

Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.


=item B<-fstack-protector-all>

Like B<-fstack-protector> except that all functions are protected.


=item B<-fsection-anchors>

Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared "anchor" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.

For example, the implementation of the following function C<foo>:

	
	static int a, b, c;
	int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }


would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with B<-fsection-anchors>, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

	
	int foo (void)
	{
	  register int *xr = &x;
	  return xr[&a - &x] + xr[&b - &x] + xr[&c - &x];
	}


Not all targets support this option.


=item B<--param> I<name>B<=>I<value>

In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
B<--param> option.

The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.

In each case, the I<value> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
I<name> are given in the following table:


=over 4


=item B<struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio>

The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between a structure frequency
and the frequency of the hottest structure in the program.  This parameter
is used by struct-reorg optimization enabled by B<-fipa-struct-reorg>.
We say that if the ratio of a structure frequency, calculated by profiling,
to the hottest structure frequency in the program is less than this
parameter, then structure reorganization is not applied to this structure.
The default is 10.


=item B<predictable-branch-outcome>

When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable. The default is 10.


=item B<max-crossjump-edges>

The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by B<-fcrossjumping> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.


=item B<min-crossjump-insns>

The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.


=item B<max-grow-copy-bb-insns>

The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.


=item B<max-goto-duplication-insns>

The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.


=item B<max-delay-slot-insn-search>

The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.


=item B<max-delay-slot-live-search>

When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.


=item B<max-gcse-memory>

The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.


=item B<max-gcse-insertion-ratio>

If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then RTL PRE will insert or remove the expression and thus
leave partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.  The default value is 20.


=item B<max-pending-list-length>

The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.


=item B<max-inline-insns-single>

Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++).
The default value is 400.


=item B<max-inline-insns-auto>

When you use B<-finline-functions> (included in B<-O3>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 40.


=item B<large-function-insns>

The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
B<--param large-function-growth>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
backend.
The default value is 2700.


=item B<large-function-growth>

Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.


=item B<large-unit-insns>

The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by B<--param inline-unit-growth>.
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to B<--param large-unit-insns>
before applying B<--param inline-unit-growth>.  The default is 10000


=item B<inline-unit-growth>

Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
The default value is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.


=item B<ipcp-unit-growth>

Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  The default value is 10 which limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.


=item B<large-stack-frame>

The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  Default value is 256 bytes.


=item B<large-stack-frame-growth>

Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.


=item B<max-inline-insns-recursive>


=item B<max-inline-insns-recursive-auto>

Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

For functions declared inline B<--param max-inline-insns-recursive> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when B<-finline-functions> (included in B<-O3>) is
enabled and B<--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto> is used.  The
default value is 450.


=item B<max-inline-recursive-depth>


=item B<max-inline-recursive-depth-auto>

Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.

For functions declared inline B<--param max-inline-recursive-depth> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when B<-finline-functions> (included in B<-O3>) is
enabled and B<--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto> is used.  The
default value is 8.


=item B<min-inline-recursive-probability>

Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.

When profile feedback is available (see B<-fprofile-generate>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expression
whose probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The default value is
10.


=item B<early-inlining-insns>

Specify growth that early inliner can make.  In effect it increases amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty.  The default value is 10.


=item B<max-early-inliner-iterations>


=item B<max-early-inliner-iterations>

Limit of iterations of early inliner.  This basically bounds number of nested
indirect calls early inliner can resolve.  Deeper chains are still handled by
late inlining.


=item B<comdat-sharing-probability>


=item B<comdat-sharing-probability>

Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with comdat visibility
will be shared across multiple compilation units.  The default value is 20.


=item B<min-vect-loop-bound>

The minimum number of iterations under which a loop will not get vectorized
when B<-ftree-vectorize> is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.  The default value is 0.


=item B<gcse-cost-distance-ratio>

Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
will be with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions which have cost
less than B<gcse-unrestricted-cost>.  Specifying 0 will disable
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.


=item B<gcse-unrestricted-cost>

Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which GCSE optimizations will not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting will be.  Specifying 0 will
allow all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
The default value is 3.


=item B<max-hoist-depth>

The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm.
The value of 0 will avoid limiting the search, but may slow down compilation
of huge functions.  The default value is 30.


=item B<max-unrolled-insns>

The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.


=item B<max-average-unrolled-insns>

The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.


=item B<max-unroll-times>

The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.


=item B<max-peeled-insns>

The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.


=item B<max-peel-times>

The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.


=item B<max-completely-peeled-insns>

The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.


=item B<max-completely-peel-times>

The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.


=item B<max-completely-peel-loop-nest-depth>

The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete peeling.


=item B<max-unswitch-insns>

The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.


=item B<max-unswitch-level>

The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.


=item B<lim-expensive>

The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.


=item B<iv-consider-all-candidates-bound>

Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.


=item B<iv-max-considered-uses>

The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.


=item B<iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound>

If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its
optimization when a new iv is added to the set.


=item B<scev-max-expr-size>

Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Large expressions slow the analyzer.


=item B<scev-max-expr-complexity>

Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Complex expressions slow the analyzer.


=item B<omega-max-vars>

The maximum number of variables in an Omega constraint system.
The default value is 128.


=item B<omega-max-geqs>

The maximum number of inequalities in an Omega constraint system.
The default value is 256.


=item B<omega-max-eqs>

The maximum number of equalities in an Omega constraint system.
The default value is 128.


=item B<omega-max-wild-cards>

The maximum number of wildcard variables that the Omega solver will
be able to insert.  The default value is 18.


=item B<omega-hash-table-size>

The size of the hash table in the Omega solver.  The default value is
550.


=item B<omega-max-keys>

The maximal number of keys used by the Omega solver.  The default
value is 500.


=item B<omega-eliminate-redundant-constraints>

When set to 1, use expensive methods to eliminate all redundant
constraints.  The default value is 0.


=item B<vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks>

The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.  See option
ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.


=item B<vect-max-version-for-alias-checks>

The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.  See option
ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.


=item B<max-iterations-to-track>


The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force algorithm
for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.


=item B<hot-bb-count-fraction>

Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.


=item B<hot-bb-frequency-fraction>

Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot


=item B<max-predicted-iterations>

The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where function contain single loop with known bound and other loop
with unknown.  We predict the known number of iterations correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other one.


=item B<align-threshold>


Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block will get aligned.


=item B<align-loop-iterations>


A loop expected to iterate at lest the selected number of iterations will get
aligned.


=item B<tracer-dynamic-coverage>


=item B<tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback>


This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.

The B<tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.


=item B<tracer-max-code-growth>

Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.


=item B<tracer-min-branch-ratio>


Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).


=item B<tracer-min-branch-ratio>


=item B<tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback>


Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.

Similarly to B<tracer-dynamic-coverage> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.


=item B<max-cse-path-length>


Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.


=item B<max-cse-insns>

The maximum instructions CSE process before flushing. The default is 1000.


=item B<ggc-min-expand>


GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM E<gt>= 1GB.  If C<getrlimit> is available, the notion of "RAM" is
the smallest of actual RAM and C<RLIMIT_DATA> or C<RLIMIT_AS>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
B<ggc-min-heapsize> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.


=item B<ggc-min-heapsize>


Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by B<ggc-min-expand>% beyond B<ggc-min-heapsize>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit which
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and B<ggc-min-expand> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.


=item B<max-reload-search-insns>

The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compile time increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default
value is 100.


=item B<max-cselib-memory-locations>

The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account.
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.


=item B<reorder-blocks-duplicate>


=item B<reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback>


Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its
estimated size is smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.

The B<reorder-block-duplicate-feedback> is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
B<reorder-block-duplicate> since information about the hot spots is more
accurate.


=item B<max-sched-ready-insns>

The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.  The default value is 100.


=item B<max-sched-region-blocks>

The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.


=item B<max-pipeline-region-blocks>

The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 15.


=item B<max-sched-region-insns>

The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.


=item B<max-pipeline-region-insns>

The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 200.


=item B<min-spec-prob>

The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source block
for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default value is 40.


=item B<max-sched-extend-regions-iters>

The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend regions.
0 - disable region extension,
N - do at most N iterations.
The default value is 0.


=item B<max-sched-insn-conflict-delay>

The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for speculative motion.
The default value is 3.


=item B<sched-spec-prob-cutoff>

The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents), so that
speculative insn will be scheduled.
The default value is 40.


=item B<sched-mem-true-dep-cost>

Minimal distance (in CPU cycles) between store and load targeting same
memory locations.  The default value is 1.


=item B<selsched-max-lookahead>

The maximum size of the lookahead window of selective scheduling.  It is a
depth of search for available instructions.
The default value is 50.


=item B<selsched-max-sched-times>

The maximum number of times that an instruction will be scheduled during
selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number of iterations
through which the instruction may be pipelined.  The default value is 2.


=item B<selsched-max-insns-to-rename>

The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that are considered
for renaming in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 2.


=item B<max-last-value-rtl>

The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression
in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default
is 10000.


=item B<integer-share-limit>

Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant.  The default value is 256.


=item B<min-virtual-mappings>

Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the incremental
SSA updater that should be registered to trigger the virtual mappings
heuristic defined by virtual-mappings-ratio.  The default value is
100.


=item B<virtual-mappings-ratio>

If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio bigger
than the number of virtual symbols to be updated, then the incremental
SSA updater switches to a full update for those symbols.  The default
ratio is 3.


=item B<ssp-buffer-size>

The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive stack smashing
protection when B<-fstack-protection> is used.


=item B<max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts>

Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.


=item B<max-fields-for-field-sensitive>

Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default is zero
for -O0, and -O1 and 100 for -Os, -O2, and -O3.


=item B<prefetch-latency>

Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance we prefetch ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see B<simultaneous-prefetches>).


=item B<simultaneous-prefetches>

Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.


=item B<l1-cache-line-size>

The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.


=item B<l1-cache-size>

The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.


=item B<l2-cache-size>

The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.


=item B<min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio>

The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.


=item B<prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio>

The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.


=item B<use-canonical-types>

Whether the compiler should use the "canonical" type system.  By
default, this should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.


=item B<switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio>

Switch initialization conversion will refuse to create arrays that are
bigger than B<switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio> times the number of
branches in the switch.


=item B<max-partial-antic-length>

Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (B<-ftree-pre>) when
optimizing at B<-O3> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter will allow an unlimited set length.


=item B<sccvn-max-scc-size>

Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during SCCVN
processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for the whole
function will not be done and optimizations depending on it will
be disabled.  The default maximum SCC size is 10000.


=item B<ira-max-loops-num>

IRA uses a regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains loops more than number given by the parameter, only at most
given number of the most frequently executed loops will form regions
for the regional register allocation.  The default value of the
parameter is 100.


=item B<ira-max-conflict-table-size>

Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm of compression conflict
table, the table can be still big for huge functions.  If the conflict
table for a function could be more than size in MB given by the
parameter, the conflict table is not built and faster, simpler, and
lower quality register allocation algorithm will be used.  The
algorithm do not use pseudo-register conflicts.  The default value of
the parameter is 2000.


=item B<ira-loop-reserved-regs>

IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decision to move loop invariants (see B<-O3>).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is described
by this parameter.  The default value of the parameter is 2 which is
minimal number of registers needed for execution of typical
instruction.  This value is the best found from numerous experiments.


=item B<loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop>

Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compile time and
in amount of needed compile time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.  The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for -O1 and 10000 for -O2 and above.


=item B<max-vartrack-size>

Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.


=item B<min-nondebug-insn-uid>

Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
B<-fvar-tracking-assignments>, but debug insns may get
(non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.


=item B<ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor>

IPA-SRA will replace a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new
parameters only when their cumulative size is less or equal to
B<ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor> times the size of the original
pointer parameter.


=item B<graphite-max-nb-scop-params>

To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters.  A variable whose value is unknown at
compile time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.


=item B<graphite-max-bbs-per-function>

To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the size of
the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The default value is
100 basic blocks.


=item B<loop-block-tile-size>

Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
B<-floop-block> or B<-floop-strip-mine>, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the B<loop-block-tile-size>
parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.


=item B<devirt-type-list-size>

IPA-CP attempts to track all possible types passed to a function's
parameter in order to perform devirtualization.
B<devirt-type-list-size> is the maximum number of types it
stores per a single formal parameter of a function.


=item B<lto-partitions>

Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR compilation.
The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation.
The default value is 32.


=item B<lto-minpartition>

Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions).
This prevents expenses of splitting very small programs into too many
partitions.


=item B<cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help>

The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions when C++
name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.


=back


=back



=head2 Options Controlling the Preprocessor


These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

If you use the B<-E> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with B<-E> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.


=over 4


=item B<-Wp,>I<option>

You can use B<-Wp,>I<option> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass I<option> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
I<option> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
B<-Wp> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using B<-Wp> and let the driver handle the
options instead.


=item B<-Xpreprocessor> I<option>

Pass I<option> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options which GCC does not know how to
recognize.

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
B<-Xpreprocessor> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.

=back






=over 4


=item B<-D> I<name>

Predefine I<name> as a macro, with definition C<1>.


=item B<-D> I<name>B<=>I<definition>

The contents of I<definition> are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a B<#define>
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.

If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With B<sh> and B<csh>,
B<-D'>I<name>B<(>I<args...>B<)=>I<definition>B<'> works.

B<-D> and B<-U> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All B<-imacros> I<file> and
B<-include> I<file> options are processed after all
B<-D> and B<-U> options.


=item B<-U> I<name>

Cancel any previous definition of I<name>, either built in or
provided with a B<-D> option.


=item B<-undef>

Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.


=item B<-I> I<dir>

Add the directory I<dir> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by B<-I> are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory I<dir> is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
.
If I<dir> begins with C<=>, then the C<=> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see B<--sysroot> and B<-isysroot>.


=item B<-o> I<file>

Write output to I<file>.  This is the same as specifying I<file>
as the second non-option argument to B<cpp>.  B<gcc> has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use B<-o> to specify the output file.


=item B<-Wall>

Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is B<-Wcomment>, B<-Wtrigraphs>,
B<-Wmultichar> and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in C<#if> expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.


=item B<-Wcomment>


=item B<-Wcomments>

Warn whenever a comment-start sequence B</*> appears in a B</*>
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a B<//> comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)


=item B<-Wtrigraphs>


Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (B<??/> at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.

This option is implied by B<-Wall>.  If B<-Wall> is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
B<-Wall> warnings, use B<-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs>.


=item B<-Wtraditional>

Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.


=item B<-Wundef>

Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
B<#if> directive, outside of B<defined>.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.


=item B<-Wunused-macros>

Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is I<used> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.

Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.

I<Note:> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:

	
	#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
	#endif



=item B<-Wendif-labels>

Warn whenever an B<#else> or an B<#endif> are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form

	
	#if FOO
	...
	#else FOO
	...
	#endif FOO


The second and third C<FOO> should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.


=item B<-Werror>

Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.


=item B<-Wsystem-headers>

Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.


=item B<-w>

Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.


=item B<-pedantic>

Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.


=item B<-pedantic-errors>

Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues
without B<-pedantic> but treats as warnings.


=item B<-M>

Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for B<make> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one B<make> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from B<-include> or
B<-imacros> command line options.

Unless specified explicitly (with B<-MT> or B<-MQ>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using B<\>-newline.  The rule has no
commands.

This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
B<-dM>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
B<-MF>, or use an environment variable like
B<DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT>.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.

Passing B<-M> to the driver implies B<-E>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit B<-w>.


=item B<-MM>

Like B<-M> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.

This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
B<#include> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in B<-MM> dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.



=item B<-MF> I<file>

When used with B<-M> or B<-MM>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no B<-MF> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.

When used with the driver options B<-MD> or B<-MMD>,
B<-MF> overrides the default dependency output file.


=item B<-MG>

In conjunction with an option such as B<-M> requesting
dependency generation, B<-MG> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
C<#include> directive without prepending any path.  B<-MG>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.

This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.


=item B<-MP>

This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors B<make> gives if you remove header
files without updating the F<Makefile> to match.

This is typical output:

	
	test.o: test.c test.h
	
	test.h:



=item B<-MT> I<target>


Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as B<.c>, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

An B<-MT> option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to B<-MT>, or use multiple B<-MT> options.

For example, B<S<-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'>> might give

	
	$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c



=item B<-MQ> I<target>


Same as B<-MT>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  B<S<-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'>> gives

	
	$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c


The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
B<-MQ>.


=item B<-MD>

B<-MD> is equivalent to B<-M -MF> I<file>, except that
B<-E> is not implied.  The driver determines I<file> based on
whether an B<-o> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of F<.d>, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a F<.d> suffix.

If B<-MD> is used in conjunction with B<-E>, any
B<-o> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without B<-E>, each B<-o>
is understood to specify a target object file.

Since B<-E> is not implied, B<-MD> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.


=item B<-MMD>

Like B<-MD> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.


=item B<-fpch-deps>

When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.


=item B<-fpch-preprocess>

This option allows use of a precompiled header together with B<-E>.  It inserts a special C<#pragma>,
C<#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "I<filename>"> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its I<filename>.
When B<-fpreprocessed> is in use, GCC recognizes this C<#pragma>
and loads the PCH.

This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on by
B<-save-temps>.

You should not write this C<#pragma> in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to GCC's
current directory.


=item B<-x c>


=item B<-x c++>


=item B<-x objective-c>


=item B<-x assembler-with-cpp>

Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
B<.c>, B<.cc>, B<.m>, or B<.S>.  Some other common
extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

I<Note:> Previous versions of cpp accepted a B<-lang> option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the B<-l>
option.


=item B<-std=>I<standard>


=item B<-ansi>

Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently CPP
knows about C and C++ standards; others may be added in the future.

I<standard>
may be one of:

=over 4


=item C<c90>


=item C<c89>


=item C<iso9899:1990>

The ISO C standard from 1990.  B<c90> is the customary shorthand for
this version of the standard.

The B<-ansi> option is equivalent to B<-std=c90>.


=item C<iso9899:199409>

The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.


=item C<iso9899:1999>


=item C<c99>


=item C<iso9899:199x>


=item C<c9x>

The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.  Before
publication, this was known as C9X.


=item C<c1x>

The next version of the ISO C standard, still under development.


=item C<gnu90>


=item C<gnu89>

The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.


=item C<gnu99>


=item C<gnu9x>

The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.


=item C<gnu1x>

The next version of the ISO C standard, still under development, plus
GNU extensions.


=item C<c++98>

The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.


=item C<gnu++98>

The same as B<-std=c++98> plus GNU extensions.  This is the
default for C++ code.

=back



=item B<-I->

Split the include path.  Any directories specified with B<-I>
options before B<-I-> are searched only for headers requested with
C<S<#include "I<file>">>; they are not searched for
C<S<#include E<lt>I<file>E<gt>>>.  If additional directories are
specified with B<-I> options after the B<-I->, those
directories are searched for all B<#include> directives.

In addition, B<-I-> inhibits the use of the directory of the current
file directory as the first search directory for C<S<#include
"I<file>">>.
This option has been deprecated.


=item B<-nostdinc>

Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories you have specified with B<-I> options
(and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.


=item B<-nostdinc++>

Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the C++ library.)


=item B<-include> I<file>

Process I<file> as if C<#include "file"> appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for I<file> is the preprocessor's working directory I<instead of>
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the C<#include "..."> search
chain as normal.

If multiple B<-include> options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.


=item B<-imacros> I<file>

Exactly like B<-include>, except that any output produced by
scanning I<file> is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.

All files specified by B<-imacros> are processed before all files
specified by B<-include>.


=item B<-idirafter> I<dir>

Search I<dir> for header files, but do it I<after> all
directories specified with B<-I> and the standard system directories
have been exhausted.  I<dir> is treated as a system include directory.
If I<dir> begins with C<=>, then the C<=> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see B<--sysroot> and B<-isysroot>.


=item B<-iprefix> I<prefix>

Specify I<prefix> as the prefix for subsequent B<-iwithprefix>
options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the
final B</>.


=item B<-iwithprefix> I<dir>


=item B<-iwithprefixbefore> I<dir>

Append I<dir> to the prefix specified previously with
B<-iprefix>, and add the resulting directory to the include search
path.  B<-iwithprefixbefore> puts it in the same place B<-I>
would; B<-iwithprefix> puts it where B<-idirafter> would.


=item B<-isysroot> I<dir>

This option is like the B<--sysroot> option, but applies only to
header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header
files and libraries).  See the B<--sysroot> option for more
information.


=item B<-imultilib> I<dir>

Use I<dir> as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.


=item B<-isystem> I<dir>

Search I<dir> for header files, after all directories specified by
B<-I> but before the standard system directories.  Mark it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.
If I<dir> begins with C<=>, then the C<=> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see B<--sysroot> and B<-isysroot>.


=item B<-iquote> I<dir>

Search I<dir> only for header files requested with
C<S<#include "I<file>">>; they are not searched for
C<S<#include E<lt>I<file>E<gt>>>, before all directories specified by
B<-I> and before the standard system directories.
If I<dir> begins with C<=>, then the C<=> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see B<--sysroot> and B<-isysroot>.


=item B<-fdirectives-only>

When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

The option's behavior depends on the B<-E> and B<-fpreprocessed>
options.

With B<-E>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as C<#define>, C<#ifdef>, and C<#error>.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the B<-dD> option is
implicitly enabled.

With B<-fpreprocessed>, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as C<__LINE__>, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with C<-E -fdirectives-only>.

With both B<-E> and B<-fpreprocessed>, the rules for
B<-fpreprocessed> take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with C<-E -fdirectives-only>.


=item B<-fdollars-in-identifiers>


Accept B<$> in identifiers.


=item B<-fextended-identifiers>

Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by
default for C99 and C++.


=item B<-fpreprocessed>

Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with B<-C> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.

B<-fpreprocessed> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions B<.i>, B<.ii> or B<.mi>.  These are the
extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by
B<-save-temps>.


=item B<-ftabstop=>I<width>

Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.


=item B<-fexec-charset=>I<charset>

Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is UTF-8.  I<charset> can be any encoding
supported by the system's C<iconv> library routine.


=item B<-fwide-exec-charset=>I<charset>

Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
corresponds to the width of C<wchar_t>.  As with
B<-fexec-charset>, I<charset> can be any encoding supported
by the system's C<iconv> library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in C<wchar_t>.


=item B<-finput-charset=>I<charset>

Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by GCC.  If the
locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  I<charset> can be any encoding
supported by the system's C<iconv> library routine.


=item B<-fworking-directory>

Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form B<-fno-working-directory>.  If the B<-P> flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
C<#line> directives are emitted whatsoever.


=item B<-fno-show-column>

Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as B<dejagnu>.


=item B<-A> I<predicate>B<=>I<answer>

Make an assertion with the predicate I<predicate> and answer
I<answer>.  This form is preferred to the older form B<-A>
I<predicate>B<(>I<answer>B<)>, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.


=item B<-A ->I<predicate>B<=>I<answer>

Cancel an assertion with the predicate I<predicate> and answer
I<answer>.


=item B<-dCHARS>

I<CHARS> is a sequence of one or more of the following characters,
and must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.


=over 4


=item B<M>

Instead of the normal output, generate a list of B<#define>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file F<foo.h>, the command

	
	touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h


will show all the predefined macros.

If you use B<-dM> without the B<-E> option, B<-dM> is
interpreted as a synonym for B<-fdump-rtl-mach>.



=item B<D>

Like B<M> except in two respects: it does I<not> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs I<both> the B<#define>
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.


=item B<N>

Like B<D>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.


=item B<I>

Output B<#include> directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.


=item B<U>

Like B<D> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
B<#undef> directives are also output for macros tested but
undefined at the time.

=back



=item B<-P>

Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.


=item B<-C>

Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.

You should be prepared for side effects when using B<-C>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a B<#>.


=item B<-CC>

Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like B<-C>, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

In addition to the side-effects of the B<-C> option, the
B<-CC> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.

The B<-CC> option is generally used to support lint comments.


=item B<-traditional-cpp>

Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
opposed to ISO C preprocessors.


=item B<-trigraphs>

Process trigraph sequences.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with B<??>, that
are defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  For example,
B<??/> stands for B<\>, so B<'??/n'> is a character
constant for a newline.  By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the B<-std> and
B<-ansi> options.

The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

	
	Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
	Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~



=item B<-remap>

Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very
short file names, such as MS-DOS.


=item B<--help>


=item B<--target-help>

Print text describing all the command line options instead of
preprocessing anything.


=item B<-v>

Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP's version number at the beginning of
execution, and report the final form of the include path.


=item B<-H>

Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
B<#include> stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled
header file is printed with B<...x> and a valid one with B<...!> .


=item B<-version>


=item B<--version>

Print out GNU CPP's version number.  With one dash, proceed to
preprocess as normal.  With two dashes, exit immediately.

=back



=head2 Passing Options to the Assembler


You can pass options to the assembler.


=over 4


=item B<-Wa,>I<option>

Pass I<option> as an option to the assembler.  If I<option>
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.


=item B<-Xassembler> I<option>

Pass I<option> as an option to the assembler.  You can use this to
supply system-specific assembler options which GCC does not know how to
recognize.

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
B<-Xassembler> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.


=back



=head2 Options for Linking


These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.


=over 4


=item I<object-file-name>

A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.


=item B<-c>


=item B<-S>


=item B<-E>

If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  


=item B<-l>I<library>


=item B<-l> I<library>

Search the library named I<library> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, B<foo.o -lz bar.o> searches library B<z>
after file F<foo.o> but before F<bar.o>.  If F<bar.o> refers
to functions in B<z>, those functions may not be loaded.

The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named F<libI<library>.a>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with B<-L>.

Normally the files found this way are library files---archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an B<-l> option and specifying a file name
is that B<-l> surrounds I<library> with B<lib> and B<.a>
and searches several directories.


=item B<-lobjc>

You need this special case of the B<-l> option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.


=item B<-nostartfiles>

Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless B<-nostdlib>
or B<-nodefaultlibs> is used.


=item B<-nodefaultlibs>

Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker, options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as C<-static-libgcc>
or C<-shared-libgcc>, will be ignored.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless B<-nostartfiles>
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to C<memcmp>,
C<memset>, C<memcpy> and C<memmove>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.


=item B<-nostdlib>

Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker, options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
C<-static-libgcc> or C<-shared-libgcc>, will be ignored.
The compiler may generate calls to C<memcmp>, C<memset>,
C<memcpy> and C<memmove>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.

One of the standard libraries bypassed by B<-nostdlib> and
B<-nodefaultlibs> is F<libgcc.a>, a library of internal subroutines
that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.

In most cases, you need F<libgcc.a> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify B<-nostdlib>
or B<-nodefaultlibs> you should usually specify B<-lgcc> as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
library subroutines.  (For example, B<__main>, used to ensure C++
constructors will be called.)


=item B<-pie>

Produce a position independent executable on targets which support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
that were used to generate code (B<-fpie>, B<-fPIE>,
or model suboptions) when you specify this option.


=item B<-rdynamic>

Pass the flag B<-export-dynamic> to the ELF linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of C<dlopen> or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.


=item B<-s>

Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.


=item B<-static>

On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.


=item B<-shared>

Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options that were used to
generate code (B<-fpic>, B<-fPIC>, or model suboptions)
when you specify this option.[1]


=item B<-shared-libgcc>


=item B<-static-libgcc>

On systems that provide F<libgcc> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
If no shared version of F<libgcc> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.

There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared F<libgcc> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared F<libgcc>.

Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
B<-shared-libgcc> whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.

If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared F<libgcc>.
If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a GNU linker that does not support option B<--eh-frame-hdr>,
it will link the shared version of F<libgcc> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of F<libgcc>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.

However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
B<-shared-libgcc>, such that it is linked with the shared
F<libgcc>.


=item B<-static-libstdc++>

When the B<g++> program is used to link a C++ program, it will
normally automatically link against B<libstdc++>.  If
F<libstdc++> is available as a shared library, and the
B<-static> option is not used, then this will link against the
shared version of F<libstdc++>.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of F<libstdc++> used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
B<-static-libstdc++> option directs the B<g++> driver to
link F<libstdc++> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.


=item B<-symbolic>

Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option B<-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs>).  Only a few systems support
this option.


=item B<-T> I<script>

Use I<script> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the B<-T> option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.


=item B<-Xlinker> I<option>

Pass I<option> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which GCC does not know how to
recognize.

If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
B<-Xlinker> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass B<-assert definitions>, you must write
B<-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions>.  It does not work to write
B<-Xlinker "-assert definitions">, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the I<option>B<=>I<value>
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
B<-Xlinker -Map=output.map> rather than
B<-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map>.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.


=item B<-Wl,>I<option>

Pass I<option> as an option to the linker.  If I<option> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, B<-Wl,-Map,output.map> passes B<-Map output.map> to the
linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
B<-Wl,-Map=output.map>.


=item B<-u> I<symbol>

Pretend the symbol I<symbol> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use B<-u> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

=head2 Options for Directory Search


These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:


=over 4


=item B<-I>I<dir>

Add the directory I<dir> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use B<-isystem> for that).  If you use more than
one B<-I> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.

If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
B<-isystem>, is also specified with B<-I>, the B<-I>
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the B<-nostdinc> and/or B<-isystem> options.


=item B<-iplugindir=>I<dir>

Set the directory to search for plugins which are passed
by B<-fplugin=>I<name> instead of
B<-fplugin=>I<path>B</>I<name>B<.so>.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.


=item B<-iquote>I<dir>

Add the directory I<dir> to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of B<#include
">I<file>B<">; they are not searched for B<#include E<lt>>I<file>B<E<gt>>,
otherwise just like B<-I>.


=item B<-L>I<dir>

Add directory I<dir> to the list of directories to be searched
for B<-l>.


=item B<-B>I<prefix>

This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
F<cpp>, F<cc1>, F<as> and F<ld>.  It tries
I<prefix> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without I<machine>B</>I<version>B</>.

For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
B<-B> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if B<-B>
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
F</usr/lib/gcc/> and F</usr/local/lib/gcc/>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
B<PATH> environment variable.

The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the B<-B>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.

B<-B> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into B<-L> options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into B<-isystem> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends B<include> to the prefix.

The run-time support file F<libgcc.a> can also be searched for using
the B<-B> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.

Another way to specify a prefix much like the B<-B> prefix is to use
the environment variable B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX>.  

As a special kludge, if the path provided by B<-B> is
F<[dir/]stageI<N>/>, where I<N> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by F<[dir/]include>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.


=item B<-specs=>I<file>

Process I<file> after the compiler reads in the standard F<specs>
file, in order to override the defaults that the F<gcc> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to F<cc1>,
F<cc1plus>, F<as>, F<ld>, etc.  More than one
B<-specs=>I<file> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.


=item B<--sysroot=>I<dir>

Use I<dir> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler would normally search for headers in
F</usr/include> and libraries in F</usr/lib>, it will instead
search F<I<dir>/usr/include> and F<I<dir>/usr/lib>.

If you use both this option and the B<-isysroot> option, then
the B<--sysroot> option will apply to libraries, but the
B<-isysroot> option will apply to header files.

The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of B<--sysroot> will still work, but the
library aspect will not.


=item B<-I->

This option has been deprecated.  Please use B<-iquote> instead for
B<-I> directories before the B<-I-> and remove the B<-I->.
Any directories you specify with B<-I> options before the B<-I->
option are searched only for the case of B<#include ">I<file>B<">;
they are not searched for B<#include E<lt>>I<file>B<E<gt>>.

If additional directories are specified with B<-I> options after
the B<-I->, these directories are searched for all B<#include>
directives.  (Ordinarily I<all> B<-I> directories are used
this way.)

In addition, the B<-I-> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for B<#include ">I<file>B<">.  There is no way to
override this effect of B<-I->.  With B<-I.> you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.

B<-I-> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, B<-I-> and B<-nostdinc> are
independent.

=back




=head2 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version


The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called B<gcc>, or
I<machine>B<-gcc> when cross-compiling, or
I<machine>B<-gcc->I<version> to run a version other than the
one that was installed last.


=head2 Hardware Models and Configurations


Each target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with B<-m>, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations---for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.

Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.




=head3 ARC Options


These options are defined for ARC implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-EL>

Compile code for little endian mode.  This is the default.


=item B<-EB>

Compile code for big endian mode.


=item B<-mmangle-cpu>

Prepend the name of the CPU to all public symbol names.
In multiple-processor systems, there are many ARC variants with different
instruction and register set characteristics.  This flag prevents code
compiled for one CPU to be linked with code compiled for another.
No facility exists for handling variants that are "almost identical".
This is an all or nothing option.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu>

Compile code for ARC variant I<cpu>.
Which variants are supported depend on the configuration.
All variants support B<-mcpu=base>, this is the default.


=item B<-mtext=>I<text-section>


=item B<-mdata=>I<data-section>


=item B<-mrodata=>I<readonly-data-section>

Put functions, data, and readonly data in I<text-section>,
I<data-section>, and I<readonly-data-section> respectively
by default.  This can be overridden with the C<section> attribute.



=back



=head3 ARM Options


These B<-m> options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:


=over 4


=item B<-mabi=>I<name>

Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: B<apcs-gnu>,
B<atpcs>, B<aapcs>, B<aapcs-linux> and B<iwmmxt>.


=item B<-mapcs-frame>

Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying B<-fomit-frame-pointer>
with this option will cause the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is B<-mno-apcs-frame>.


=item B<-mapcs>

This is a synonym for B<-mapcs-frame>.



=item B<-mthumb-interwork>

Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets cannot
be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
B<-mno-thumb-interwork>, since slightly larger code is generated
when B<-mthumb-interwork> is specified.


=item B<-mno-sched-prolog>

Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions will start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start if functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is B<-msched-prolog>.


=item B<-mfloat-abi=>I<name>

Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values
are: B<soft>, B<softfp> and B<hard>.

Specifying B<soft> causes GCC to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
B<softfp> allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
B<hard> allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.

The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
compatible set of libraries.


=item B<-mhard-float>

Equivalent to B<-mfloat-abi=hard>.


=item B<-msoft-float>

Equivalent to B<-mfloat-abi=soft>.


=item B<-mlittle-endian>

Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.


=item B<-mbig-endian>

Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.


=item B<-mwords-little-endian>

This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form B<32107654>.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian ARM processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<name>

This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name
to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  Permissible names are: B<arm2>, B<arm250>,
B<arm3>, B<arm6>, B<arm60>, B<arm600>, B<arm610>,
B<arm620>, B<arm7>, B<arm7m>, B<arm7d>, B<arm7dm>,
B<arm7di>, B<arm7dmi>, B<arm70>, B<arm700>,
B<arm700i>, B<arm710>, B<arm710c>, B<arm7100>,
B<arm720>,
B<arm7500>, B<arm7500fe>, B<arm7tdmi>, B<arm7tdmi-s>,
B<arm710t>, B<arm720t>, B<arm740t>,
B<strongarm>, B<strongarm110>, B<strongarm1100>,
B<strongarm1110>,
B<arm8>, B<arm810>, B<arm9>, B<arm9e>, B<arm920>,
B<arm920t>, B<arm922t>, B<arm946e-s>, B<arm966e-s>,
B<arm968e-s>, B<arm926ej-s>, B<arm940t>, B<arm9tdmi>,
B<arm10tdmi>, B<arm1020t>, B<arm1026ej-s>,
B<arm10e>, B<arm1020e>, B<arm1022e>,
B<arm1136j-s>, B<arm1136jf-s>, B<mpcore>, B<mpcorenovfp>,
B<arm1156t2-s>, B<arm1156t2f-s>, B<arm1176jz-s>, B<arm1176jzf-s>,
B<cortex-a5>, B<cortex-a8>, B<cortex-a9>, B<cortex-a15>,
B<cortex-r4>, B<cortex-r4f>, B<cortex-m4>, B<cortex-m3>,
B<cortex-m1>,
B<cortex-m0>,
B<xscale>, B<iwmmxt>, B<iwmmxt2>, B<ep9312>.


=item B<-mtune=>I<name>

This option is very similar to the B<-mcpu=> option, except that
instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that GCC should
tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
will generate based on the CPU specified by a B<-mcpu=> option.
For some ARM implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.


=item B<-march=>I<name>

This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the B<-mcpu=> option.  Permissible names are: B<armv2>,
B<armv2a>, B<armv3>, B<armv3m>, B<armv4>, B<armv4t>,
B<armv5>, B<armv5t>, B<armv5e>, B<armv5te>,
B<armv6>, B<armv6j>,
B<armv6t2>, B<armv6z>, B<armv6zk>, B<armv6-m>,
B<armv7>, B<armv7-a>, B<armv7-r>, B<armv7-m>,
B<iwmmxt>, B<iwmmxt2>, B<ep9312>.


=item B<-mfpu=>I<name>


=item B<-mfpe=>I<number>


=item B<-mfp=>I<number>

This specifies what floating point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: B<fpa>, B<fpe2>,
B<fpe3>, B<maverick>, B<vfp>, B<vfpv3>, B<vfpv3-fp16>,
B<vfpv3-d16>, B<vfpv3-d16-fp16>, B<vfpv3xd>, B<vfpv3xd-fp16>,
B<neon>, B<neon-fp16>, B<vfpv4>, B<vfpv4-d16>,
B<fpv4-sp-d16> and B<neon-vfpv4>.
B<-mfp> and B<-mfpe> are synonyms for
B<-mfpu>=B<fpe>I<number>, for compatibility with older versions
of GCC.

If B<-msoft-float> is specified this specifies the format of
floating point values.

If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON extension
(e.g. B<-mfpu>=B<neon>), note that floating-point
operations will not be used by GCC's auto-vectorization pass unless
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> is also specified.  This is
because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.


=item B<-mfp16-format=>I<name>

Specify the format of the C<__fp16> half-precision floating-point type.
Permissible names are B<none>, B<ieee>, and B<alternative>;
the default is B<none>, in which case the C<__fp16> type is not
defined.  


=item B<-mstructure-size-boundary=>I<n>

The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the COFF
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying ABI supports it.

Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.


=item B<-mabort-on-noreturn>

Generate a call to the function C<abort> at the end of a
C<noreturn> function.  It will be executed if the function tries to
return.


=item B<-mlong-calls>


=item B<-mno-long-calls>

Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based
version of subroutine call instruction.

Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
which have the B<short-call> attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a B<#pragma no_long_calls> directive and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The exception to this rule is
that weak function definitions, functions with the B<long-call>
attribute or the B<section> attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a B<#pragma long_calls> directive, will always be
turned into long calls.

This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
B<-mno-long-calls> will restore the default behavior, as will
placing the function calls within the scope of a B<#pragma
long_calls_off> directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.


=item B<-msingle-pic-base>

Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.


=item B<-mpic-register=>I<reg>

Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  The default is R10
unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is used.


=item B<-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns>

Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work around
problems with invalid Maverick instruction combinations.  This option
is only valid if the B<-mcpu=ep9312> option has been used to
enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick floating
point co-processor.  This option is not enabled by default, since the
problem is only present in older Maverick implementations.  The default
can be re-enabled by use of the B<-mno-cirrus-fix-invalid-insns>
switch.


=item B<-mpoke-function-name>

Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:

	
	     t0
	         .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
	         .align
	     t1
	         .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
	     arm_poke_function_name
	         mov     ip, sp
	         stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
	         sub     fp, ip, #4


When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
C<pc> stored at C<fp + 0>.  If the trace function then looks at
location C<pc - 12> and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length C<((pc[-3]) & 0xff000000)>.


=item B<-mthumb>

Generate code for the Thumb instruction set.  The default is to
use the 32-bit ARM instruction set.
This option automatically enables either 16-bit Thumb-1 or
mixed 16/32-bit Thumb-2 instructions based on the B<-mcpu=>I<name>
and B<-march=>I<name> options.  This option is not passed to the
assembler. If you want to force assembler files to be interpreted as Thumb code,
either add a B<.thumb> directive to the source or pass the B<-mthumb>
option directly to the assembler by prefixing it with B<-Wa>.


=item B<-mtpcs-frame>

Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is B<-mno-tpcs-frame>.


=item B<-mtpcs-leaf-frame>

Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is B<-mno-apcs-leaf-frame>.


=item B<-mcallee-super-interworking>

Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.


=item B<-mcaller-super-interworking>

Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.


=item B<-mtp=>I<name>

Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are B<soft>, which generates calls to C<__aeabi_read_tp>,
B<cp15>, which fetches the thread pointer from C<cp15> directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and B<auto>, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
B<auto>.


=item B<-mword-relocations>

Only generate absolute relocations on word sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32).
This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when B<-fpic> or B<-fPIC>
is specified.


=item B<-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd>

Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when C<ldrd> instructions
with overlapping destination and base registers are used.  This option avoids
generating these instructions.  This option is enabled by default when
B<-mcpu=cortex-m3> is specified.


=back



=head3 AVR Options


These options are defined for AVR implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-mmcu=>I<mcu>

Specify ATMEL AVR instruction set or MCU type.

Instruction set avr1 is for the minimal AVR core, not supported by the C
compiler, only for assembler programs (MCU types: at90s1200, attiny10,
attiny11, attiny12, attiny15, attiny28).

Instruction set avr2 (default) is for the classic AVR core with up to
8K program memory space (MCU types: at90s2313, at90s2323, attiny22,
at90s2333, at90s2343, at90s4414, at90s4433, at90s4434, at90s8515,
at90c8534, at90s8535).

Instruction set avr3 is for the classic AVR core with up to 128K program
memory space (MCU types: atmega103, atmega603, at43usb320, at76c711).

Instruction set avr4 is for the enhanced AVR core with up to 8K program
memory space (MCU types: atmega8, atmega83, atmega85).

Instruction set avr5 is for the enhanced AVR core with up to 128K program
memory space (MCU types: atmega16, atmega161, atmega163, atmega32, atmega323,
atmega64, atmega128, at43usb355, at94k).


=item B<-mno-interrupts>

Generated code is not compatible with hardware interrupts.
Code size will be smaller.


=item B<-mcall-prologues>

Functions prologues/epilogues expanded as call to appropriate
subroutines.  Code size will be smaller.


=item B<-mtiny-stack>

Change only the low 8 bits of the stack pointer.


=item B<-mint8>

Assume int to be 8 bit integer.  This affects the sizes of all types: A
char will be 1 byte, an int will be 1 byte, a long will be 2 bytes
and long long will be 4 bytes.  Please note that this option does not
comply to the C standards, but it will provide you with smaller code
size.

=back



=head4 C<EIND> and Devices with more than 128k Bytes of Flash


Pointers in the implementation are 16 bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can address any code address in the
range of 64k words.

In order to faciliate indirect jump on devices with more than 128k
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
C<EIND> that serves as most significant part of the target address
when C<EICALL> or C<EIJMP> instructions are used.

Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows and
are subject to some limitations:


=over 4



=item *

The compiler never sets C<EIND>.


=item *

The startup code from libgcc never sets C<EIND>.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and avr-libc.
For the impact of avr-libc on C<EIND>, see the
S<avr-libc user manual> (C<http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual>).


=item *

The compiler uses C<EIND> implicitely in C<EICALL>/C<EIJMP>
instructions or might read C<EIND> directly.


=item *

The compiler assumes that C<EIND> never changes during the startup
code or run of the application. In particular, C<EIND> is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.


=item *

It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up C<EIND>
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section C<.init3>, and thus prior to general startup code that
initializes RAM and calls constructors.


=item *

For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker will
generate I<stubs>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
I<trampolines>. Thus, the indirect call/jump will jump to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.


=item *

Stubs will be generated automatically by the linker if
the following two conditions are met:

=over 4



=item -<The address of a label is taken by means of the C<gs> modifier>

(short for I<generate stubs>) like so:
	
	LDI r24, lo8(gs(<func>))
	LDI r25, hi8(gs(<func>))


=item -<The final location of that label is in a code segment>

I<outside> the segment where the stubs are located.

=back



=item *

The compiler will emit such C<gs> modifiers for code labels in the
following situations:

=over 4


=item -<Taking address of a function or code label.>


=item -<Computed goto.>


=item -<If prologue-save function is used, see B<-mcall-prologues>>

command line option.

=item -<Switch/case dispatch tables. If you do not want such dispatch>

tables you can specify the B<-fno-jump-tables> command line option.

=item -<C and C++ constructors/destructors called during startup/shutdown.>


=item -<If the tools hit a C<gs()> modifier explained above.>


=back



=item *

The default linker script is arranged for code with C<EIND = 0>.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with C<EIND != 0>, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with C<.trampolines> into the segment where C<EIND>
points to.


=item *

Jumping to non-symbolic addresses like so is I<not> supported:

	
	int main (void)
	{
	    /* Call function at word address 0x2 */
	    return ((int(*)(void)) 0x2)();
	}


Instead, a stub has to be set up:

	
	int main (void)
	{
	    extern int func_4 (void);
	
	    /* Call function at byte address 0x4 */
	    return func_4();
	}


and the application be linked with C<-Wl,--defsym,func_4=0x4>.
Alternatively, C<func_4> can be defined in the linker script.

=head3 Blackfin Options



=over 4


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu>[B<->I<sirevision>]

Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.  Currently, I<cpu>
can be one of B<bf512>, B<bf514>, B<bf516>, B<bf518>,
B<bf522>, B<bf523>, B<bf524>, B<bf525>, B<bf526>,
B<bf527>, B<bf531>, B<bf532>, B<bf533>,
B<bf534>, B<bf536>, B<bf537>, B<bf538>, B<bf539>,
B<bf542>, B<bf544>, B<bf547>, B<bf548>, B<bf549>,
B<bf542m>, B<bf544m>, B<bf547m>, B<bf548m>, B<bf549m>,
B<bf561>.
The optional I<sirevision> specifies the silicon revision of the target
Blackfin processor.  Any workarounds available for the targeted silicon revision
will be enabled.  If I<sirevision> is B<none>, no workarounds are enabled.
If I<sirevision> is B<any>, all workarounds for the targeted processor
will be enabled.  The C<__SILICON_REVISION__> macro is defined to two
hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor numbers in the silicon
revision.  If I<sirevision> is B<none>, the C<__SILICON_REVISION__>
is not defined.  If I<sirevision> is B<any>, the
C<__SILICON_REVISION__> is defined to be C<0xffff>.
If this optional I<sirevision> is not used, GCC assumes the latest known
silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin processor.

Support for B<bf561> is incomplete.  For B<bf561>,
Only the processor macro is defined.
Without this option, B<bf532> is used as the processor by default.
The corresponding predefined processor macros for I<cpu> is to
be defined.  And for B<bfin-elf> toolchain, this causes the hardware BSP
provided by libgloss to be linked in if B<-msim> is not given.


=item B<-msim>

Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be linked in.  This option
has effect only for B<bfin-elf> toolchain.
Certain other options, such as B<-mid-shared-library> and
B<-mfdpic>, imply B<-msim>.


=item B<-momit-leaf-frame-pointer>

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
B<-fomit-frame-pointer> removes the frame pointer for all functions
which might make debugging harder.


=item B<-mspecld-anomaly>

When enabled, the compiler will ensure that the generated code does not
contain speculative loads after jump instructions. If this option is used,
C<__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS> is defined.


=item B<-mno-specld-anomaly>

Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from occurring.


=item B<-mcsync-anomaly>

When enabled, the compiler will ensure that the generated code does not
contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon after conditional branches.
If this option is used, C<__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS> is defined.


=item B<-mno-csync-anomaly>

Don't generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC instructions from
occurring too soon after a conditional branch.


=item B<-mlow-64k>

When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the knowledge that
the entire program fits into the low 64k of memory.


=item B<-mno-low-64k>

Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the default.


=item B<-mstack-check-l1>

Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad memory by the
uClinux kernel.


=item B<-mid-shared-library>

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method.
This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies B<-fPIC>.
With a B<bfin-elf> target, this option implies B<-msim>.


=item B<-mno-id-shared-library>

Generate code that doesn't assume ID based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.


=item B<-mleaf-id-shared-library>

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method,
but assumes that this library or executable won't link against any other
ID shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps
and calls.


=item B<-mno-leaf-id-shared-library>

Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any ID shared
libraries.  Slower code will be generated for jump and call insns.


=item B<-mshared-library-id=n>

Specified the identification number of the ID based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 will generate more compact code, specifying
other values will force the allocation of that number to the current
library but is no more space or time efficient than omitting this option.


=item B<-msep-data>

Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute in place in
an environment without virtual memory management by eliminating relocations
against the text section.


=item B<-mno-sep-data>

Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.
This is the default.


=item B<-mlong-calls>


=item B<-mno-long-calls>

Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
will lie outside of the 24 bit addressing range of the offset based
version of subroutine call instruction.

This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
B<-mno-long-calls> will restore the default behavior.  Note these
switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
function calls via function pointers.


=item B<-mfast-fp>

Link with the fast floating-point library. This library relaxes some of
the IEEE floating-point standard's rules for checking inputs against
Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest of performance.


=item B<-minline-plt>

Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without B<-mfdpic>.


=item B<-mmulticore>

Build standalone application for multicore Blackfin processor. Proper
start files and link scripts will be used to support multicore.
This option defines C<__BFIN_MULTICORE>. It can only be used with
B<-mcpu=bf561>[B<->I<sirevision>]. It can be used with
B<-mcorea> or B<-mcoreb>. If it's used without
B<-mcorea> or B<-mcoreb>, single application/dual core
programming model is used. In this model, the main function of Core B
should be named as coreb_main. If it's used with B<-mcorea> or
B<-mcoreb>, one application per core programming model is used.
If this option is not used, single core application programming
model is used.


=item B<-mcorea>

Build standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using
one application per core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts will be used to support Core A. This option
defines C<__BFIN_COREA>. It must be used with B<-mmulticore>.


=item B<-mcoreb>

Build standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using
one application per core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts will be used to support Core B. This option
defines C<__BFIN_COREB>. When this option is used, coreb_main
should be used instead of main. It must be used with
B<-mmulticore>.


=item B<-msdram>

Build standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files and
link scripts will be used to put the application into SDRAM.
Loader should initialize SDRAM before loading the application
into SDRAM. This option defines C<__BFIN_SDRAM>.


=item B<-micplb>

Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at runtime.  This has an effect on certain
anomaly workarounds.  For Linux targets, the default is to assume ICPLBs
are enabled; for standalone applications the default is off.

=back



=head3 CRIS Options


These options are defined specifically for the CRIS ports.


=over 4


=item B<-march=>I<architecture-type>


=item B<-mcpu=>I<architecture-type>

Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
I<architecture-type> are B<v3>, B<v8> and B<v10> for
respectively ETRAXS< >4, ETRAXS< >100, and ETRAXS< >100S< >LX.
Default is B<v0> except for cris-axis-linux-gnu, where the default is
B<v10>.


=item B<-mtune=>I<architecture-type>

Tune to I<architecture-type> everything applicable about the generated
code, except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  The
choices for I<architecture-type> are the same as for
B<-march=>I<architecture-type>.


=item B<-mmax-stack-frame=>I<n>

Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds I<n> bytes.


=item B<-metrax4>


=item B<-metrax100>

The options B<-metrax4> and B<-metrax100> are synonyms for
B<-march=v3> and B<-march=v8> respectively.


=item B<-mmul-bug-workaround>


=item B<-mno-mul-bug-workaround>

Work around a bug in the C<muls> and C<mulu> instructions for CPU
models where it applies.  This option is active by default.


=item B<-mpdebug>

Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in the assembly
code.  This option also has the effect to turn off the B<#NO_APP>
formatted-code indicator to the assembler at the beginning of the
assembly file.


=item B<-mcc-init>

Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction; always emit
compare and test instructions before use of condition codes.


=item B<-mno-side-effects>

Do not emit instructions with side-effects in addressing modes other than
post-increment.


=item B<-mstack-align>


=item B<-mno-stack-align>


=item B<-mdata-align>


=item B<-mno-data-align>


=item B<-mconst-align>


=item B<-mno-const-align>

These options (no-options) arranges (eliminate arrangements) for the
stack-frame, individual data and constants to be aligned for the maximum
single data access size for the chosen CPU model.  The default is to
arrange for 32-bit alignment.  ABI details such as structure layout are
not affected by these options.


=item B<-m32-bit>


=item B<-m16-bit>


=item B<-m8-bit>

Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above, these options
arrange for stack-frame, writable data and constants to all be 32-bit,
16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The default is 32-bit alignment.


=item B<-mno-prologue-epilogue>


=item B<-mprologue-epilogue>

With B<-mno-prologue-epilogue>, the normal function prologue and
epilogue that sets up the stack-frame are omitted and no return
instructions or return sequences are generated in the code.  Use this
option only together with visual inspection of the compiled code: no
warnings or errors are generated when call-saved registers must be saved,
or storage for local variable needs to be allocated.


=item B<-mno-gotplt>


=item B<-mgotplt>

With B<-fpic> and B<-fPIC>, don't generate (do generate)
instruction sequences that load addresses for functions from the PLT part
of the GOT rather than (traditional on other architectures) calls to the
PLT.  The default is B<-mgotplt>.


=item B<-melf>

Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf and
cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.


=item B<-mlinux>

Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-linux-gnu target.


=item B<-sim>

This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf arranges
to link with input-output functions from a simulator library.  Code,
initialized data and zero-initialized data are allocated consecutively.


=item B<-sim2>

Like B<-sim>, but pass linker options to locate initialized data at
0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at 0x80000000.

=back



=head3 CRX Options


These options are defined specifically for the CRX ports.


=over 4



=item B<-mmac>

Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled by default.


=item B<-mpush-args>

Push instructions will be used to pass outgoing arguments when functions
are called. Enabled by default.

=back



=head3 Darwin Options


These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.

FSF GCC on Darwin does not create "fat" object files; it will create
an object file for the single architecture that it was built to
target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create "fat" files if multiple
B<-arch> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
F<lipo>.

The subtype of the file created (like B<ppc7400> or B<ppc970> or
B<i686>) is determined by the flags that specify the ISA
that GCC is targetting, like B<-mcpu> or B<-march>.  The
B<-force_cpusubtype_ALL> option can be used to override this.

The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
mismatch.  The assembler, F<as>, will only permit instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a B<ppc750> object file.
The linker for shared libraries, F</usr/bin/libtool>, will fail
and print an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a B<ppc970> object file in a B<ppc7400> library).  The linker
for executables, F<ld>, will quietly give the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.


=over 4


=item B<-F>I<dir>

Add the framework directory I<dir> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by B<-I> options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.

A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a B<"Headers"> and/or
B<"PrivateHeaders"> directory contained directly in it that ends
in B<".framework">.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the B<".framework">.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
B<"Headers"> being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's B<"Frameworks"> directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks, in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in B<"/System/Library/Frameworks"> and
B<"/Library/Frameworks">.  An example include looks like
C<#include E<lt>Framework/header.hE<gt>>, where B<Framework> denotes
the name of the framework and header.h is found in the
B<"PrivateHeaders"> or B<"Headers"> directory.


=item B<-iframework>I<dir>

Like B<-F> except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this B<-iframework> and
B<-F> is that with B<-iframework> the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
I<dir>.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.


=item B<-gused>

Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For STABS
debugging format, this enables B<-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols>.
This is by default ON.


=item B<-gfull>

Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.


=item B<-mmacosx-version-min=>I<version>

The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
is I<version>.  Typical values of I<version> include C<10.1>,
C<10.2>, and C<10.3.9>.

If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices which
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.


=item B<-mkernel>

Enable kernel development mode.  The B<-mkernel> option sets
B<-static>, B<-fno-common>, B<-fno-cxa-atexit>,
B<-fno-exceptions>, B<-fno-non-call-exceptions>,
B<-fapple-kext>, B<-fno-weak> and B<-fno-rtti> where
applicable.  This mode also sets B<-mno-altivec>,
B<-msoft-float>, B<-fno-builtin> and
B<-mlong-branch> for PowerPC targets.


=item B<-mone-byte-bool>

Override the defaults for B<bool> so that B<sizeof(bool)==1>.
By default B<sizeof(bool)> is B<4> when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and B<1> when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.

B<Warning:> The B<-mone-byte-bool> switch causes GCC
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this
switch to conform to a non-default data model.


=item B<-mfix-and-continue>


=item B<-ffix-and-continue>


=item B<-findirect-data>

Generate code suitable for fast turn around development.  Needed to
enable gdb to dynamically load C<.o> files into already running
programs.  B<-findirect-data> and B<-ffix-and-continue>
are provided for backwards compatibility.


=item B<-all_load>

Loads all members of static archive libraries.
See man ld(1) for more information.


=item B<-arch_errors_fatal>

Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong architecture
to be fatal.


=item B<-bind_at_load>

Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic linker will
bind all undefined references when the file is loaded or launched.


=item B<-bundle>

Produce a Mach-o bundle format file.
See man ld(1) for more information.


=item B<-bundle_loader> I<executable>

This option specifies the I<executable> that will be loading the build
output file being linked.  See man ld(1) for more information.


=item B<-dynamiclib>

When passed this option, GCC will produce a dynamic library instead of
an executable when linking, using the Darwin F<libtool> command.


=item B<-force_cpusubtype_ALL>

This causes GCC's output file to have the I<ALL> subtype, instead of
one controlled by the B<-mcpu> or B<-march> option.

=head3 DEC Alpha Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-mno-soft-float>


=item B<-msoft-float>

Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When B<-msoft-float> is specified,
functions in F<libgcc.a> will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.

Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.


=item B<-mfp-reg>


=item B<-mno-fp-regs>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
B<-mno-fp-regs> implies B<-msoft-float>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in C<$0> instead of C<$f0>.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with B<-mno-fp-regs> must also be compiled with that
option.

A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.


=item B<-mieee>

The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE floating
point standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE compliant code
I<except> that the I<inexact-flag> is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro C<_IEEE_FP> is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option B<-ieee_with_no_inexact>.


=item B<-mieee-with-inexact>

This is like B<-mieee> except the generated code also maintains
the IEEE I<inexact-flag>.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to
C<_IEEE_FP>, C<_IEEE_FP_EXACT> is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the I<inexact-flag>, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option B<-ieee_with_inexact>.


=item B<-mfp-trap-mode=>I<trap-mode>

This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
Other Alpha compilers call this option B<-fptm> I<trap-mode>.
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:


=over 4


=item B<n>

This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).


=item B<u>

In addition to the traps enabled by B<n>, underflow traps are enabled
as well.


=item B<su>

Like B<u>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).


=item B<sui>

Like B<su>, but inexact traps are enabled as well.

=back



=item B<-mfp-rounding-mode=>I<rounding-mode>

Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
B<-fprm> I<rounding-mode>.  The I<rounding-mode> can be one
of:


=over 4


=item B<n>

Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.


=item B<m>

Round towards minus infinity.


=item B<c>

Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards zero.


=item B<d>

Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control register
(I<fpcr>, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
I<fpcr>, B<d> corresponds to round towards plus infinity.

=back



=item B<-mtrap-precision=>I<trap-precision>

In the Alpha architecture, floating point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:


=over 4


=item B<p>

Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating point exception.


=item B<f>

Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating point exception.


=item B<i>

Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating point exception.

=back


Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
B<-scope_safe> and B<-resumption_safe>.


=item B<-mieee-conformant>

This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify B<-mtrap-precision=i> and either
B<-mfp-trap-mode=su> or B<-mfp-trap-mode=sui>.  Its only effect
is to emit the line B<.eflag 48> in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.  Under DEC Unix, this has the effect that
IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.


=item B<-mbuild-constants>

Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a literal and
generate code to load it from the data segment at runtime.

Use this option to require GCC to construct I<all> integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).

You would typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.


=item B<-malpha-as>


=item B<-mgas>

Select whether to generate code to be assembled by the vendor-supplied
assembler (B<-malpha-as>) or by the GNU assembler B<-mgas>.


=item B<-mbwx>


=item B<-mno-bwx>


=item B<-mcix>


=item B<-mno-cix>


=item B<-mfix>


=item B<-mno-fix>


=item B<-mmax>


=item B<-mno-max>

Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction
sets supported by the CPU type specified via B<-mcpu=> option or that
of the CPU on which GCC was built if none was specified.


=item B<-mfloat-vax>


=item B<-mfloat-ieee>

Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating point
arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.


=item B<-mexplicit-relocs>


=item B<-mno-explicit-relocs>

Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.


=item B<-msmall-data>


=item B<-mlarge-data>

When B<-mexplicit-relocs> is in effect, static data is
accessed via I<gp-relative> relocations.  When B<-msmall-data>
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a I<small data area>
(the C<.sdata> and C<.sbss> sections) and are accessed via
16-bit relocations off of the C<$gp> register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.

The default is B<-mlarge-data>.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use C<malloc> or C<mmap> to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.

When generating code for shared libraries, B<-fpic> implies
B<-msmall-data> and B<-fPIC> implies B<-mlarge-data>.


=item B<-msmall-text>


=item B<-mlarge-text>

When B<-msmall-text> is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When B<-msmall-data>
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same C<$gp> value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.

The default is B<-mlarge-text>.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type>

Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type I<cpu_type>.  You can specify either the B<EV>
style name or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports scheduling
parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6 family of processors and will
choose the default values for the instruction set from the processor
you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, GCC will default
to the processor on which the compiler was built.

Supported values for I<cpu_type> are

Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value B<native>,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
B<-mcpu=native> has no effect if GCC does not recognize
the processor.


=item B<-mtune=>I<cpu_type>

Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
I<cpu_type>.  The instruction set is not changed.

Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value B<native>,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
B<-mtune=native> has no effect if GCC does not recognize

=item B<-mmemory-latency=>I<time>

Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory
references as seen by the application.  This number is highly
dependent on the memory access patterns used by the application
and the size of the external cache on the machine.

Valid options for I<time> are


=over 4


=item I<number>

A decimal number representing clock cycles.


=item B<L1>


=item B<L2>


=item B<L3>


=item B<main>

The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock cycles for
"typical" EV4 & EV5 hardware for the Level 1, 2 & 3 caches
(also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main memory.
Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.

routine for the debugger.


=item B<-mmalloc64>

Default to 64bit memory allocation routines.

=back



=head3 FR30 Options


These options are defined specifically for the FR30 port.


=over 4



=item B<-msmall-model>

Use the small address space model.  This can produce smaller code, but
it does assume that all symbolic values and addresses will fit into a
20-bit range.


=item B<-mno-lsim>

Assume that run-time support has been provided and so there is no need
to include the simulator library (F<libsim.a>) on the linker
command line.

=item B<-mdword>


Change ABI to use double word insns.


=item B<-mno-dword>


Do not use double word instructions.


=item B<-mdouble>

=item B<-mno-media>


Do not use media instructions.


=item B<-mmuladd>


Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.


=item B<-mno-muladd>


Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.


=item B<-mfdpic>


Select the FDPIC ABI, that uses function descriptors to represent
pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related options, it
implies B<-fPIE>.  With B<-fpic> or B<-fpie>, it
assumes GOT entries and small data are within a 12-bit range from the
GOT base address; with B<-fPIC> or B<-fPIE>, GOT offsets
are computed with 32 bits.
With a B<bfin-elf> target, this option implies B<-msim>.


=item B<-minline-plt>


Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without B<-mfdpic>.
It's enabled by default if optimizing for speed and compiling for
shared libraries (i.e., B<-fPIC> or B<-fpic>), or when an
optimization option such as B<-O3> or above is present in the
command line.


=item B<-mTLS>


Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.


=item B<-mtls>


Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.


=item B<-mgprel-ro>


Enable the use of C<GPREL> relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data
that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by default,
except for B<-fpic> or B<-fpie>: even though it may help
make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4.
With B<-fPIC> or B<-fPIE>, it trades 3 instructions for 4,
one of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need
for a GOT entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a
win.  If it is not, B<-mno-gprel-ro> can be used to disable it.


=item B<-multilib-library-pic>


Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries.  It's implied by
B<-mlibrary-pic>, as well as by B<-fPIC> and
B<-fpic> without B<-mfdpic>.  You should never have to use
it explicitly.


=item B<-mlinked-fp>


Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame pointer whenever
a stack frame is allocated.  This option is enabled by default and can
be disabled with B<-mno-linked-fp>.


=item B<-mlong-calls>


Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the current
compilation unit.  This allows the functions to be placed anywhere
within the 32-bit address space.


=item B<-malign-labels>


Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting nops into the
previous packet.  This option only has an effect when VLIW packing
is enabled.  It doesn't create new packets; it merely adds nops to
existing ones.


=item B<-mlibrary-pic>


Generate position-independent EABI code.


=item B<-macc-4>


Use only the first four media accumulator registers.


=item B<-macc-8>

=head3 GNU/Linux Options


These B<-m> options are defined for GNU/Linux targets:


=over 4


=item B<-mglibc>

Use the GNU C library.  This is the default except

=item B<-muclibc>

Use uClibc C library.  This is the default on
B<*-*-linux-*uclibc*> targets.


=item B<-mbionic>

Use Bionic C library.  This is the default on
B<*-*-linux-*android*> targets.


=item B<-mandroid>

Compile code compatible with Android platform.  This is the default on
B<*-*-linux-*android*> targets.

When compiling, this option enables B<-mbionic>, B<-fPIC>,
B<-fno-exceptions> and B<-fno-rtti> by default.  When linking,
this option makes the GCC driver pass Android-specific options to the linker.
Finally, this option causes the preprocessor macro C<__ANDROID__>
to be defined.


=item B<-tno-android-cc>

Disable compilation effects of B<-mandroid>, i.e., do not enable
B<-mbionic>, B<-fPIC>, B<-fno-exceptions> and
B<-fno-rtti> by default.

Generate code for the H8S.


=item B<-mn>

Generate code for the H8S and H8/300H in the normal mode.  This switch
must be used either with B<-mh> or B<-ms>.


=item B<-ms2600>

Generate code for the H8S/2600.  This switch must be used with B<-ms>.

Make C<int> data 32 bits by default.


=item B<-malign-300>

On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for the H8/300.
The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align longs and floats on 4
byte boundaries.
B<-malign-300> causes them to be aligned on 2 byte boundaries.
This option has no effect on the H8/300.

=head3 HPPA Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:


=over 4


=item B<-march=>I<architecture-type>

Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
I<architecture-type> are B<1.0> for PA 1.0, B<1.1> for PA
1.1, and B<2.0> for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to
F</usr/lib/sched.models> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
architecture option for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
architectures will run on higher numbered architectures, but not the
other way around.


=item B<-mpa-risc-1-0>


=item B<-mpa-risc-1-1>


=item B<-mpa-risc-2-0>

Synonyms for B<-march=1.0>, B<-march=1.1>, and B<-march=2.0> respectively.


=item B<-mbig-switch>

Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.


=item B<-mjump-in-delay>

Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.


=item B<-mdisable-fpregs>

Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context switching of
floating point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating point operations, the compiler will abort.


=item B<-mdisable-indexing>

Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.


=item B<-mno-space-regs>

Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.


=item B<-mfast-indirect-calls>

Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows GCC to emit code which performs faster indirect calls.

This option will not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.


=item B<-mfixed-range=>I<register-range>

Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.


=item B<-mlong-load-store>

Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the B<+k> option to
the HP compilers.


=item B<-mportable-runtime>

Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.


=item B<-mgas>

Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.


=item B<-mschedule=>I<cpu-type>

Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
I<cpu-type>.  The choices for I<cpu-type> are B<700>
B<7100>, B<7100LC>, B<7200>, B<7300> and B<8000>.  Refer
to F</usr/lib/sched.models> on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
B<8000>.


=item B<-mlinker-opt>

Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.


=item B<-msoft-float>

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
B<Warning:> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

B<-msoft-float> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile I<all> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile F<libgcc.a>, the
library that comes with GCC, with B<-msoft-float> in order for
this to work.


=item B<-msio>

Generate the predefine, C<_SIO>, for server IO.  The default is
B<-mwsio>.  This generates the predefines, C<__hp9000s700>,
C<__hp9000s700__> and C<_WSIO>, for workstation IO.  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.


=item B<-mgnu-ld>

Use GNU ld specific options.  This passes B<-shared> to ld when
building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This option does not
have any affect on which ld is called, it only changes what parameters
are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the
B<--with-ld> configure option, GCC's program search path, and
finally by the user's B<PATH>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed
using B<which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`>.  This option is only available
on the 64 bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with B<hppa*64*-*-hpux*>.


=item B<-mhp-ld>

Use HP ld specific options.  This passes B<-b> to ld when building
a shared library and passes B<+Accept TypeMismatch> to ld on all
links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not have any affect on
which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are passed to that
ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the B<--with-ld>
configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's
B<PATH>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed using B<which
`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`>.  This option is only available on the 64 bit
HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with B<hppa*64*-*-hpux*>.


=item B<-mlong-calls>

Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.

Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
B<-ffunction-sections> option, or when using the B<-mgas>
and B<-mno-portable-runtime> options together under HP-UX with
the SOM linker.

It is normally not desirable to use this option as it will degrade
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
and it is quite long.


=item B<-munix=>I<unix-std>

Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
UNIX standard.  The choices for I<unix-std> are B<93>, B<95>
and B<98>.  B<93> is supported on all HP-UX versions.  B<95>
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  B<98> is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are B<93> for HP-UX 10.00,
B<95> for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and B<98> for HP-UX 11.11
and later.

B<-munix=93> provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4.
B<-munix=95> provides additional predefines for C<XOPEN_UNIX>
and C<_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED>, and the startfile F<unix95.o>.
B<-munix=98> provides additional predefines for C<_XOPEN_UNIX>,
C<_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED>, C<_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE> and
C<_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500>, and the startfile F<unix98.o>.

It is I<important> to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, I<extreme> care is needed in using this
option.

Library code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX
standard must test, set and restore the variable I<__xpg4_extended_mask>
as appropriate.  Most GNU software doesn't provide this capability.


=item B<-nolibdld>

Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
B<-static> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.


=item B<-static>

The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the B<-static> option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.

On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the B<-static> option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
B<-nolibdld> option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
adding these link options.


=item B<-threads>

Add support for multithreading with the I<dce thread> library
under HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
linker.

=head3 Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of
computers:


=over 4


=item B<-mtune=>I<cpu-type>

Tune to I<cpu-type> everything applicable about the generated code, except
for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  The choices for
I<cpu-type> are:

=over 4


=item I<generic>

Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors.
If you know the CPU on which your code will run, then you should use
the corresponding B<-mtune> option instead of
B<-mtune=generic>.  But, if you do not know exactly what CPU users
of your application will have, then you should use this option.

As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this
option will change.  Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of
GCC, the code generated option will change to reflect the processors
that were most common when that version of GCC was released.

There is no B<-march=generic> option because B<-march>
indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
B<-mtune> indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of
processors) for which the code is optimized.

=item I<native>

This selects the CPU to tune for at compilation time by determining
the processor type of the compiling machine.  Using B<-mtune=native>
will produce code optimized for the local machine under the constraints
of the selected instruction set.  Using B<-march=native> will
enable all instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence
the result might not run on different machines).

=item I<k8-sse3, opteron-sse3, athlon64-sse3>

Improved versions of k8, opteron and athlon64 with SSE3 instruction set support.

=item I<amdfam10, barcelona>

AMD Family 10h core based CPUs with x86-64 instruction set support.  (This
supersets MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4A, 3DNow!, enhanced 3DNow!, ABM and 64-bit
instruction set extensions.)

=item I<winchip-c6>

set support.

Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set support.  (No scheduling is
implemented for this chip.)

=item I<geode>

Embedded AMD CPU with MMX and 3DNow! instruction set support.

=back


While picking a specific I<cpu-type> will schedule things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code that
does not run on the i386 without the B<-march=>I<cpu-type> option
being used.


=item B<-march=>I<cpu-type>

Generate instructions for the machine type I<cpu-type>.  The choices
for I<cpu-type> are the same as for B<-mtune>.  Moreover,
specifying B<-march=>I<cpu-type> implies B<-mtune=>I<cpu-type>.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu-type>

A deprecated synonym for B<-mtune>.


=item B<-mfpmath=>I<unit>

Generate floating point arithmetics for selected unit I<unit>.  The choices
for I<unit> are:


=over 4


=item B<387>

Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option will run almost everywhere.
The temporary results are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision
specified by the type resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips.  See B<-ffloat-store> for more detailed description.

This is the default choice for i386 compiler.


=item B<sse>

Use scalar floating point instructions present in the SSE instruction set.
This instruction set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the AMD line
by Athlon-4, Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of SSE
instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics, thus the double and
extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.  Later version, present
only in Pentium4 and the future AMD x86-64 chips supports double precision
arithmetics too.

For the i386 compiler, you need to use B<-march=>I<cpu-type>, B<-msse>
or B<-msse2> switches to enable SSE extensions and make this option
effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.

The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80bit.

This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.


=item B<sse,387>


=item B<sse+387>


=item B<both>

Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively double the
amount of available registers and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and SSE the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the GCC register allocator does not model separate
functional units well resulting in instable performance.

=back



=item B<-masm=>I<dialect>

Output asm instructions using selected I<dialect>.  Supported
choices are B<intel> or B<att> (the default one).  Darwin does
not support B<intel>.


=item B<-mieee-fp>


=item B<-mno-ieee-fp>

Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating point
comparisons.  These handle correctly the case where the result of a
comparison is unordered.


=item B<-msoft-float>

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
B<Warning:> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted even if
B<-msoft-float> is used.


=item B<-mno-fp-ret-in-387>

Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
C<float> and C<double> in an FPU register, even if there
is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an FPU.

The option B<-mno-fp-ret-in-387> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary CPU registers instead.


=item B<-mno-fancy-math-387>

Some 387 emulators do not support the C<sin>, C<cos> and
C<sqrt> instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when B<-march>
indicates that the target CPU will always have an FPU and so the
instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> switch.


=item B<-malign-double>


=item B<-mno-align-double>

Control whether GCC aligns C<double>, C<long double>, and
C<long long> variables on a two word boundary or a one word
boundary.  Aligning C<double> variables on a two word boundary will
produce code that runs somewhat faster on a B<Pentium> at the
expense of more memory.

On x86-64, B<-malign-double> is enabled by default.

B<Warning:> if you use the B<-malign-double> switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.


=item B<-m96bit-long-double>


=item B<-m128bit-long-double>

These switches control the size of C<long double> type.  The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so B<-m96bit-long-double> is the default in 32 bit mode.

Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer C<long double>
to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the ABI, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
B<-m128bit-long-double> will align C<long double>
to a 16 byte boundary by padding the C<long double> with an additional
32 bit zero.

In the x86-64 compiler, B<-m128bit-long-double> is the default choice as
its ABI specifies that C<long double> is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.

Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a C<long double>.

B<Warning:> if you override the default value for your target ABI, the
structures and arrays containing C<long double> variables will change
their size as well as function calling convention for function taking
C<long double> will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary
compatible with arrays or structures in code compiled without that switch.


=item B<-mlarge-data-threshold=>I<number>

When B<-mcmodel=medium> is specified, the data greater than
I<threshold> are placed in large data section.  This value must be the
same across all object linked into the binary and defaults to 65535.


=item B<-mrtd>

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the C<ret> I<num>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.

You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute B<stdcall>.  You can also
override the B<-mrtd> option by using the function attribute
B<cdecl>.  

B<Warning:> this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including C<printf>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)


=item B<-mregparm=>I<num>

Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute B<regparm>.


B<Warning:> if you use this switch, and
I<num> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.


=item B<-msseregparm>

Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double arguments
and return values.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute B<sseregparm>.


B<Warning:> if you use this switch then you must build all
modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes
the system libraries and startup modules.


=item B<-mvect8-ret-in-mem>

Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.  This is the
default on Solaris@tie{}8 and 9 and VxWorks to match the ABI of the Sun
Studio compilers until version 12.  Later compiler versions (starting
with Studio 12 Update@tie{}1) follow the ABI used by other x86 targets, which
is the default on Solaris@tie{}10 and later.  I<Only> use this option if
you need to remain compatible with existing code produced by those
previous compiler versions or older versions of GCC.


=item B<-mpc32>


=item B<-mpc64>


=item B<-mpc80>


Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.  When B<-mpc32>
is specified, the significands of results of floating-point operations are
rounded to 24 bits (single precision); B<-mpc64> rounds the
significands of results of floating-point operations to 53 bits (double
precision) and B<-mpc80> rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is
the default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in higher
precisions are not available to the programmer without setting the FPU
control word explicitly.

Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the default
80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that some mathematical
libraries assume that extended precision (80 bit) floating-point operations
are enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer significant
loss of accuracy, typically through so-called "catastrophic cancellation",
when this option is used to set the precision to less than extended precision.


=item B<-mstackrealign>

Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the B<-mstackrealign>
option will generate an alternate prologue and epilogue that realigns the
runtime stack if necessary.  This supports mixing legacy codes that keep
a 4-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack for
SSE compatibility.  See also the attribute C<force_align_arg_pointer>,
applicable to individual functions.


=item B<-mpreferred-stack-boundary=>I<num>

Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to I<num>
byte boundary.  If B<-mpreferred-stack-boundary> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).


=item B<-mincoming-stack-boundary=>I<num>

Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to I<num> byte
boundary.  If B<-mincoming-stack-boundary> is not specified,
the one specified by B<-mpreferred-stack-boundary> will be used.

On Pentium and PentiumPro, C<double> and C<long double> values
should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see B<-malign-double>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III, the
Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type C<__m128> may not work
properly if it is not 16 byte aligned.

To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to B<-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2>.

=item B<-mno-tbm>

These switches enable or disable the use of instructions in the MMX,
SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, AES, PCLMUL, FSGSBASE, RDRND,
F16C, SSE4A, FMA4, XOP, LWP, ABM, BMI, or 3DNow! extended instruction sets.
These extensions are also available as built-in functions: see
B<X86 Built-in Functions>, for details of the functions enabled and
disabled by these switches.

To have SSE/SSE2 instructions generated automatically from floating-point
code (as opposed to 387 instructions), see B<-mfpmath=sse>.

GCC depresses SSEx instructions when B<-mavx> is used. Instead, it
generates new AVX instructions or AVX equivalence for all SSEx instructions
when needed.

These options will enable GCC to use these extended instructions in
generated code, even without B<-mfpmath=sse>.  Applications which
perform runtime CPU detection must compile separate files for each
supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular,
the file containing the CPU detection code should be compiled without
these options.


=item B<-mfused-madd>


=item B<-mno-fused-madd>

Do (don't) generate code that uses the fused multiply/add or multiply/subtract
instructions.  The default is to use these instructions.


=item B<-mcld>

This option instructs GCC to emit a C<cld> instruction in the prologue
of functions that use string instructions.  String instructions depend on
the DF flag to select between autoincrement or autodecrement mode.  While the
ABI specifies the DF flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
systems violate this specification by not clearing the DF flag in their
exception dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the DF flag
set which leads to wrong direction mode, when string instructions are used.
This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets by configuring
GCC with the B<--enable-cld> configure option.  Generation of C<cld>
instructions can be suppressed with the B<-mno-cld> compiler option
in this case.


=item B<-mvzeroupper>

This option instructs GCC to emit a C<vzeroupper> instruction
before a transfer of control flow out of the function to minimize
AVX to SSE transition penalty as well as remove unnecessary zeroupper 
intrinsics.


=item B<-mcx16>

This option will enable GCC to use CMPXCHG16B instruction in generated code.
CMPXCHG16B allows for atomic operations on 128-bit double quadword (or oword)
data types.  This is useful for high resolution counters that could be updated
by multiple processors (or cores).  This instruction is generated as part of
atomic built-in functions: see B<Atomic Builtins> for details.


=item B<-msahf>

This option will enable GCC to use SAHF instruction in generated 64-bit code.
Early Intel CPUs with Intel 64 lacked LAHF and SAHF instructions supported
by AMD64 until introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December 2005.  LAHF and
SAHF are load and store instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.
In 64-bit mode, SAHF instruction is used to optimize C<fmod>, C<drem>
or C<remainder> built-in functions: see B<Other Builtins> for details.


=item B<-mmovbe>

This option will enable GCC to use movbe instruction to implement
C<__builtin_bswap32> and C<__builtin_bswap64>.


=item B<-mcrc32>

This option will enable built-in functions, C<__builtin_ia32_crc32qi>,
C<__builtin_ia32_crc32hi>. C<__builtin_ia32_crc32si> and
C<__builtin_ia32_crc32di> to generate the crc32 machine instruction.


=item B<-mrecip>

This option will enable GCC to use RCPSS and RSQRTSS instructions (and their
vectorized variants RCPPS and RSQRTPS) with an additional Newton-Raphson step
to increase precision instead of DIVSS and SQRTSS (and their vectorized
variants) for single precision floating point arguments.  These instructions
are generated only when B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> is enabled
together with B<-finite-math-only> and B<-fno-trapping-math>.
Note that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).

Note that GCC implements 1.0f/sqrtf(x) in terms of RSQRTSS (or RSQRTPS)
already with B<-ffast-math> (or the above option combination), and
doesn't need B<-mrecip>.


=item B<-mveclibabi=>I<type>

Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an
external library.  Supported types are C<svml> for the Intel short
vector math library and C<acml> for the AMD math core library style
of interfacing.  GCC will currently emit calls to C<vmldExp2>,
C<vmldLn2>, C<vmldLog102>, C<vmldLog102>, C<vmldPow2>,
C<vmldTanh2>, C<vmldTan2>, C<vmldAtan2>, C<vmldAtanh2>,
C<vmldCbrt2>, C<vmldSinh2>, C<vmldSin2>, C<vmldAsinh2>,
C<vmldAsin2>, C<vmldCosh2>, C<vmldCos2>, C<vmldAcosh2>,
C<vmldAcos2>, C<vmlsExp4>, C<vmlsLn4>, C<vmlsLog104>,
C<vmlsLog104>, C<vmlsPow4>, C<vmlsTanh4>, C<vmlsTan4>,
C<vmlsAtan4>, C<vmlsAtanh4>, C<vmlsCbrt4>, C<vmlsSinh4>,
C<vmlsSin4>, C<vmlsAsinh4>, C<vmlsAsin4>, C<vmlsCosh4>,
C<vmlsCos4>, C<vmlsAcosh4> and C<vmlsAcos4> for corresponding
function type when B<-mveclibabi=svml> is used and C<__vrd2_sin>,
C<__vrd2_cos>, C<__vrd2_exp>, C<__vrd2_log>, C<__vrd2_log2>,
C<__vrd2_log10>, C<__vrs4_sinf>, C<__vrs4_cosf>,
C<__vrs4_expf>, C<__vrs4_logf>, C<__vrs4_log2f>,
C<__vrs4_log10f> and C<__vrs4_powf> for corresponding function type
when B<-mveclibabi=acml> is used. Both B<-ftree-vectorize> and
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> have to be enabled. A SVML or ACML ABI
compatible library will have to be specified at link time.


=item B<-mabi=>I<name>

Generate code for the specified calling convention.  Permissible values
are: B<sysv> for the ABI used on GNU/Linux and other systems and
B<ms> for the Microsoft ABI.  The default is to use the Microsoft
ABI when targeting Windows.  On all other systems, the default is the
SYSV ABI.  You can control this behavior for a specific function by
using the function attribute B<ms_abi>/B<sysv_abi>.



=item B<-mpush-args>


=item B<-mno-push-args>

Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter
and usually equally fast as method using SUB/MOV operations and is enabled
by default.  In some cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.


=item B<-maccumulate-outgoing-args>

If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments will be
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs
because of reduced dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable
increase in code size.  This switch implies B<-mno-push-args>.


=item B<-mthreads>

Support thread-safe exception handling on B<Mingw32>.  Code that relies
on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the
B<-mthreads> option.  When compiling, B<-mthreads> defines
B<-D_MT>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
B<-lmingwthrd> which cleans up per thread exception handling data.


=item B<-mno-align-stringops>

Do not align destination of inlined string operations.  This switch reduces
code size and improves performance in case the destination is already aligned,
but GCC doesn't know about it.


=item B<-minline-all-stringops>

By default GCC inlines string operations only when destination is known to be
aligned at least to 4 byte boundary.  This enables more inlining, increase code
size, but may improve performance of code that depends on fast memcpy, strlen
and memset for short lengths.


=item B<-minline-stringops-dynamically>

For string operation of unknown size, inline runtime checks so for small
blocks inline code is used, while for large blocks library call is used.


=item B<-mstringop-strategy=>I<alg>

Overwrite internal decision heuristic about particular algorithm to inline
string operation with.  The allowed values are C<rep_byte>,
C<rep_4byte>, C<rep_8byte> for expanding using i386 C<rep> prefix
of specified size, C<byte_loop>, C<loop>, C<unrolled_loop> for
expanding inline loop, C<libcall> for always expanding library call.


=item B<-momit-leaf-frame-pointer>

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
B<-fomit-frame-pointer> removes the frame pointer for all functions
which might make debugging harder.


=item B<-mtls-direct-seg-refs>


=item B<-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs>

Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets from the
TLS segment register (C<%gs> for 32-bit, C<%fs> for 64-bit),
or whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or not this
is legal depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the
segment to cover the entire TLS area.

For systems that use GNU libc, the default is on.


=item B<-msse2avx>


=item B<-mno-sse2avx>

Specify that the assembler should encode SSE instructions with VEX
prefix.  The option B<-mavx> turns this on by default.


=item B<-mfentry>


=item B<-mno-fentry>

If profiling is active B<-pg> put the profiling
counter call before prologue.
Note: On x86 architectures the attribute C<ms_hook_prologue>
isn't possible at the moment for B<-mfentry> and B<-pg>.


=item B<-m8bit-idiv>


=item B<-mno-8bit-idiv>

On some processors, like Intel Atom, 8bit unsigned integer divide is
much faster than 32bit/64bit integer divide.  This option will generate a
runt-time check.  If both dividend and divisor are within range of 0
to 255, 8bit unsigned integer divide will be used instead of
32bit/64bit integer divide.


=item B<-mavx256-split-unaligned-load>


=item B<-mavx256-split-unaligned-store>

Split 32-byte AVX unaligned load and store.


=back


These B<-m> switches are supported in addition to the above
on AMD x86-64 processors in 64-bit environments.


=over 4


=item B<-m32>


=item B<-m64>

Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.
The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and
generates code that runs on any i386 system.
The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
to 64 bits and generates code for AMD's x86-64 architecture. For
darwin only the -m64 option turns off the B<-fno-pic> and
B<-mdynamic-no-pic> options.


=item B<-mno-red-zone>

Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated
by the x86-64 ABI, it is a 128-byte area beyond the location of the
stack pointer that will not be modified by signal or interrupt handlers
and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer.  The flag B<-mno-red-zone> disables this red zone.


=item B<-mcmodel=small>

Generate code for the small code model: the program and its symbols must
be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address space.  Pointers are 64 bits.
Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.  This is the default
code model.


=item B<-mcmodel=kernel>

Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the
negative 2 GB of the address space.
This model has to be used for Linux kernel code.


=item B<-mcmodel=medium>

Generate code for the medium model: The program is linked in the lower 2
GB of the address space.  Small symbols are also placed there.  Symbols
with sizes larger than B<-mlarge-data-threshold> are put into
large data or bss sections and can be located above 2GB.  Programs can
be statically or dynamically linked.


=item B<-mcmodel=large>

Generate code for the large model: This model makes no assumptions
about addresses and sizes of sections.

=head3 i386 and x86-64 Windows Options


These additional options are available for Windows targets:


=over 4


=item B<-mconsole>

This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that a console application is to be generated, by
instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type
required for console applications.
This is the default behavior for Cygwin and MinGW targets.


=item B<-mdll>

This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that a DLL - a dynamic link library - is to be

startup object and entry point.


=item B<-mnop-fun-dllimport>

This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the dllimport attribute should be ignored.


=item B<-mthread>

This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies
that MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.


=item B<-municode>

This option is available for mingw-w64 targets.  It specifies
that the UNICODE macro is getting pre-defined and that the
unicode capable runtime startup code is chosen.


=item B<-mwin32>

This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the typical Windows pre-defined macros are to
be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence the choice
of runtime library/startup code.


=item B<-mwindows>

This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that a GUI application is to be generated by
instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type
appropriately.

This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that
the executable flag for stack used by nested functions isn't
set. This is necessary for binaries running in kernel mode of
Windows, as there the user32 API, which is used to set executable
privileges, isn't available.


=item B<-mpe-aligned-commons>

This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the GNU extension to the PE file format that
permits the correct alignment of COMMON variables should be
used when generating code.  It will be enabled by default if
GCC detects that the target assembler found during configuration
supports the feature.

=item B<-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns>

If enabled, data speculative instructions will be chosen for schedule
only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This will make
the use of the data speculation much more conservative.
The default is 'disable'.


=item B<-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns>


=item B<-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns>

If enabled, control speculative instructions will be chosen for schedule
only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This will make
the use of the control speculation much more conservative.
The default is 'disable'.


=item B<-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path>


=item B<-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path>

If enabled, speculative dependencies will be considered during
computation of the instructions priorities.  This will make the use of the

instruction group. Frequently useful to prevent cache bank conflicts.
The default value is 1.


=item B<-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit>

Disallow more than `msched-max-memory-insns' in instruction group.
Otherwise, limit is `soft' meaning that we would prefer non-memory operations
when limit is reached but may still schedule memory operations.


=back



=head3 IA-64/VMS Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the IA-64/VMS implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-mvms-return-codes>

Return VMS condition codes from main. The default is to return POSIX
style condition (e.g. error) codes.


=item B<-mdebug-main=>I<prefix>

Flag the first routine whose name starts with I<prefix> as the main
routine for the debugger.


=item B<-mmalloc64>

Default to 64bit memory allocation routines.

=over 4


=item B<-mbarrel-shift-enabled>

Enable barrel-shift instructions.


=item B<-mdivide-enabled>

Enable divide and modulus instructions.


=item B<-mmultiply-enabled>

Enable multiply instructions.

=item B<-muser-enabled>

Enable user-defined instructions.


=back



=head3 M32C Options



=over 4


=item B<-mcpu=>I<name>

Select the CPU for which code is generated.  I<name> may be one of
B<r8c> for the R8C/Tiny series, B<m16c> for the M16C (up to
/60) series, B<m32cm> for the M16C/80 series, or B<m32c> for
the M32C/80 series.


=item B<-msim>

Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
an alternate runtime library to be linked in which supports, for
example, file I/O.  You must not use this option when generating
programs that will run on real hardware; you must provide your own
runtime library for whatever I/O functions are needed.


=item B<-memregs=>I<number>

Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC will use
during code generation.  These pseudo-registers will be used like real
registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit the
code into available registers, and the performance penalty of using
memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a program must
be compiled with the same value for this option.  Because of that, you
must not use this option with the default runtime libraries gcc
builds.


=back



=head3 M32R/D Options


These B<-m> options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:


=over 4


=item B<-m32r2>

Generate code for the M32R/2.

=item B<-mmodel=small>

Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their addresses
can be loaded with the C<ld24> instruction), and assume all subroutines
are reachable with the C<bl> instruction.
This is the default.

The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
C<model> attribute.


=item B<-mmodel=medium>

Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the compiler
will generate C<seth/add3> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume all subroutines are reachable with the C<bl> instruction.


=item B<-mmodel=large>

Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the compiler
will generate C<seth/add3> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume subroutines may not be reachable with the C<bl> instruction
(the compiler will generate the much slower C<seth/add3/jl>
instruction sequence).


=item B<-msdata=none>

Disable use of the small data area.  Variables will be put into
one of B<.data>, B<bss>, or B<.rodata> (unless the
C<section> attribute has been specified).
This is the default.

The small data area consists of sections B<.sdata> and B<.sbss>.
Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
C<section> attribute using one of these sections.


=item B<-msdata=sdata>

Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
generate special code to reference them.


=item B<-msdata=use>

Put small global and static data in the small data area, and generate
special instructions to reference them.


=item B<-G> I<num>

Put global and static objects less than or equal to I<num> bytes
into the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
sections.  The default value of I<num> is 8.
The B<-msdata> option must be set to one of B<sdata> or B<use>
for this option to have any effect.

All modules should be compiled with the same B<-G> I<num> value.
Compiling with different values of I<num> may or may not work; if it
doesn't the linker will give an error message---incorrect code will not be
generated.


=item B<-mdebug>

Makes the M32R specific code in the compiler display some statistics
that might help in debugging programs.


=item B<-malign-loops>

Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.


=item B<-mno-align-loops>

Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops.  This is the default.


=item B<-missue-rate=>I<number>

Issue I<number> instructions per cycle.  I<number> can only be 1
or 2.


=item B<-mbranch-cost=>I<number>

I<number> can only be 1 or 2.  If it is 1 then branches will be
preferred over conditional code, if it is 2, then the opposite will
apply.


=item B<-mflush-trap=>I<number>

Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache.  The default is
12.  Valid numbers are between 0 and 15 inclusive.


=item B<-mno-flush-trap>

Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a trap.


=item B<-mflush-func=>I<name>

Specifies the name of the operating system function to call to flush
the cache.  The default is I<_flush_cache>, but a function call
will only be used if a trap is not available.


=item B<-mno-flush-func>

Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the cache.

=head3 M680x0 Options


These are the B<-m> options defined for M680x0 and ColdFire processors.
The default settings depend on which architecture was selected when
the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common choices
are given below.


=over 4


=item B<-march=>I<arch>

Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction set
architecture.  Permissible values of I<arch> for M680x0
architectures are: B<68000>, B<68010>, B<68020>,
B<68030>, B<68040>, B<68060> and B<cpu32>.  ColdFire
architectures are selected according to Freescale's ISA classification
and the permissible values are: B<isaa>, B<isaaplus>,
B<isab> and B<isac>.

gcc defines a macro B<__mcf>I<arch>B<__> whenever it is generating
code for a ColdFire target.  The I<arch> in this macro is one of the
B<-march> arguments given above.

When used together, B<-march> and B<-mtune> select code
that runs on a family of similar processors but that is optimized
for a particular microarchitecture.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu>

Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire processor.
The M680x0 I<cpu>s are: B<68000>, B<68010>, B<68020>,
B<68030>, B<68040>, B<68060>, B<68302>, B<68332>

=back


B<-mcpu=>I<cpu> overrides B<-march=>I<arch> if
I<arch> is compatible with I<cpu>.  Other combinations of
B<-mcpu> and B<-march> are rejected.

gcc defines the macro B<__mcf_cpu_>I<cpu> when ColdFire target
I<cpu> is selected.  It also defines B<__mcf_family_>I<family>,
where the value of I<family> is given by the table above.


=item B<-mtune=>I<tune>

Tune the code for a particular microarchitecture, within the
constraints set by B<-march> and B<-mcpu>.
The M680x0 microarchitectures are: B<68000>, B<68010>,
B<68020>, B<68030>, B<68040>, B<68060>
and B<cpu32>.  The ColdFire microarchitectures
are: B<cfv1>, B<cfv2>, B<cfv3>, B<cfv4> and B<cfv4e>.

You can also use B<-mtune=68020-40> for code that needs
to run relatively well on 68020, 68030 and 68040 targets.
B<-mtune=68020-60> is similar but includes 68060 targets
as well.  These two options select the same tuning decisions as
B<-m68020-40> and B<-m68020-60> respectively.

gcc defines the macros B<__mc>I<arch> and B<__mc>I<arch>B<__>
when tuning for 680x0 architecture I<arch>.  It also defines
B<mc>I<arch> unless either B<-ansi> or a non-GNU B<-std>
option is used.  If gcc is tuning for a range of architectures,
as selected by B<-mtune=68020-40> or B<-mtune=68020-60>,
it defines the macros for every architecture in the range.

gcc also defines the macro B<__m>I<uarch>B<__> when tuning for
ColdFire microarchitecture I<uarch>, where I<uarch> is one
of the arguments given above.


=item B<-m68000>

Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68030-based systems.  It is equivalent to
B<-march=68030>.

Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68040-based systems.  It is equivalent to
B<-march=68040>.

Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new instructions.
This results in code which can run relatively efficiently on either a
68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The generated code does use the
68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68040.

The option is equivalent to B<-march=68020> B<-mtune=68020-40>.


=item B<-m68020-60>

Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new instructions.
This results in code which can run relatively efficiently on either a

68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68060.

The option is equivalent to B<-march=68020> B<-mtune=68020-60>.


=item B<-mhard-float>


=item B<-m68881>

Generate floating-point instructions.  This is the default for 68020

the default is "on" for ColdFire architectures and "off" for M680x0
architectures.  Otherwise, the default is taken from the target CPU
(either the default CPU, or the one specified by B<-mcpu>).  For
example, the default is "off" for B<-mcpu=5206> and "on" for
B<-mcpu=5206e>.

gcc defines the macro B<__mcfhwdiv__> when this option is enabled.


=item B<-mshort>

Consider type C<int> to be 16 bits wide, like C<short int>.
Additionally, parameters passed on the stack are also aligned to a
16-bit boundary even on targets whose API mandates promotion to 32-bit.


=item B<-mno-short>

Do not consider type C<int> to be 16 bits wide.  This is the default.


=item B<-mnobitfield>

=item B<-mbitfield>

Do use the bit-field instructions.  The B<-m68020> option implies
B<-mbitfield>.  This is the default if you use a configuration
designed for a 68020.


=item B<-mrtd>

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return with the C<rtd>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.

This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including C<printf>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)

The C<rtd> instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.


=item B<-mno-rtd>

Do not use the calling conventions selected by B<-mrtd>.
This is the default.


=item B<-malign-int>


=item B<-mno-align-int>

Control whether GCC aligns C<int>, C<long>, C<long long>,
C<float>, C<double>, and C<long double> variables on a 32-bit
boundary (B<-malign-int>) or a 16-bit boundary (B<-mno-align-int>).
Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.

B<Warning:> if you use the B<-malign-int> switch, GCC will
align structures containing the above types  differently than
most published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.


=item B<-mpcrel>

Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead of
using a global offset table.  At present, this option implies B<-fpic>,
allowing at most a 16-bit offset for pc-relative addressing.  B<-fPIC> is
not presently supported with B<-mpcrel>, though this could be supported for
68020 and higher processors.


=item B<-mno-strict-align>


=item B<-mstrict-align>

Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references will be handled by
the system.


=item B<-msep-data>

Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute in place in
an environment without virtual memory management.  This option implies
B<-fPIC>.


=item B<-mno-sep-data>

Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.
This is the default.


=item B<-mid-shared-library>

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method.
This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies B<-fPIC>.


=item B<-mno-id-shared-library>

Generate code that doesn't assume ID based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.


=item B<-mshared-library-id=n>

Specified the identification number of the ID based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 will generate more compact code, specifying
other values will force the allocation of that number to the current
library but is no more space or time efficient than omitting this option.


=item B<-mxgot>


=item B<-mno-xgot>

When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the GOT has more than 8192 entries.  This code is
larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; B<-fPIC> suffices.

GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT.
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:

	
	relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar


If this happens, you should recompile your code with B<-mxgot>.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
B<-mxgot> is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.

Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use B<-mxgot> when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 GOT entries.  Very few do.

These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
position-independent code.

=head3 M68hc1x Options


These are the B<-m> options defined for the 68hc11 and 68hc12
microcontrollers.  The default values for these options depends on
which style of microcontroller was selected when the compiler was configured;
the defaults for the most common choices are given below.


=over 4


=item B<-m6811>


=item B<-m68hc11>

Generate output for a 68HC11.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68HC11-based systems.


=item B<-m6812>


=item B<-m68hc12>

Generate output for a 68HC12.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68HC12-based systems.


=item B<-m68S12>


=item B<-m68hcs12>

Generate output for a 68HCS12.


=item B<-mauto-incdec>

Enable the use of 68HC12 pre and post auto-increment and auto-decrement
addressing modes.


=item B<-minmax>


=item B<-mnominmax>

Enable the use of 68HC12 min and max instructions.


=item B<-mlong-calls>


=item B<-mno-long-calls>

Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to be
far away, the compiler will use the C<call> instruction to
call a function and the C<rtc> instruction for returning.


=item B<-mshort>

Consider type C<int> to be 16 bits wide, like C<short int>.


=item B<-msoft-reg-count=>I<count>

Specify the number of pseudo-soft registers which are used for the
code generation.  The maximum number is 32.  Using more pseudo-soft
register may or may not result in better code depending on the program.
The default is 4 for 68HC11 and 2 for 68HC12.


=back



=head3 MCore Options


These are the B<-m> options defined for the Motorola M*Core
processors.

Prefer word access when reading byte quantities.


=item B<-mlittle-endian>


=item B<-mbig-endian>

Generate code for a little endian target.


=item B<-m210>


=item B<-m340>

Generate code for the 210 processor.


=item B<-mno-lsim>

Assume that run-time support has been provided and so omit the
simulator library (F<libsim.a)> from the linker command line.


=item B<-mstack-increment=>I<size>

Set the maximum amount for a single stack increment operation.  Large
values can increase the speed of programs which contain functions
that need a large amount of stack space, but they can also trigger a
segmentation fault if the stack is extended too much.  The default
value is 0x1000.


=back



=head3 MeP Options



=over 4



=item B<-mabsdiff>

Enables the C<abs> instruction, which is the absolute difference
between two registers.


=item B<-mall-opts>

Enables all the optional instructions - average, multiply, divide, bit
operations, leading zero, absolute difference, min/max, clip, and
saturation.



=item B<-maverage>

Enables the C<ave> instruction, which computes the average of two
registers.


=item B<-mbased=>I<n>

Variables of size I<n> bytes or smaller will be placed in the
C<.based> section by default.  Based variables use the C<$tp>
register as a base register, and there is a 128 byte limit to the
C<.based> section.


=item B<-mbitops>

Enables the bit operation instructions - bit test (C<btstm>), set
(C<bsetm>), clear (C<bclrm>), invert (C<bnotm>), and
test-and-set (C<tas>).


=item B<-mc=>I<name>

Selects which section constant data will be placed in.  I<name> may
be C<tiny>, C<near>, or C<far>.


=item B<-mclip>

Enables the C<clip> instruction.  Note that C<-mclip> is not
useful unless you also provide C<-mminmax>.


=item B<-mconfig=>I<name>

Selects one of the build-in core configurations.  Each MeP chip has
one or more modules in it; each module has a core CPU and a variety of
coprocessors, optional instructions, and peripherals.  The
C<MeP-Integrator> tool, not part of GCC, provides these
configurations through this option; using this option is the same as
using all the corresponding command line options.  The default
configuration is C<default>.


=item B<-mcop>

Enables the coprocessor instructions.  By default, this is a 32-bit
coprocessor.  Note that the coprocessor is normally enabled via the
C<-mconfig=> option.


=item B<-mcop32>

Enables the 32-bit coprocessor's instructions.


=item B<-mcop64>

Enables the 64-bit coprocessor's instructions.


=item B<-mivc2>

Enables IVC2 scheduling.  IVC2 is a 64-bit VLIW coprocessor.

Causes constant variables to be placed in the C<.near> section.


=item B<-mdiv>

Enables the C<div> and C<divu> instructions.


=item B<-meb>

Generate big-endian code.


=item B<-mel>

Generate little-endian code.


=item B<-mio-volatile>

Tells the compiler that any variable marked with the C<io>
attribute is to be considered volatile.


=item B<-ml>

Causes variables to be assigned to the C<.far> section by default.


=item B<-mleadz>

Enables the C<leadz> (leading zero) instruction.


=item B<-mm>

Causes variables to be assigned to the C<.near> section by default.


=item B<-mminmax>

Enables the C<min> and C<max> instructions.


=item B<-mmult>

Enables the multiplication and multiply-accumulate instructions.


=item B<-mno-opts>

Disables all the optional instructions enabled by C<-mall-opts>.


=item B<-mrepeat>

Enables the C<repeat> and C<erepeat> instructions, used for
low-overhead looping.


=item B<-ms>

Causes all variables to default to the C<.tiny> section.  Note
that there is a 65536 byte limit to this section.  Accesses to these
variables use the C<%gp> base register.


=item B<-msatur>

Enables the saturation instructions.  Note that the compiler does not
currently generate these itself, but this option is included for
compatibility with other tools, like C<as>.


=item B<-msdram>

Link the SDRAM-based runtime instead of the default ROM-based runtime.


=item B<-msim>

Link the simulator runtime libraries.


=item B<-msimnovec>

Link the simulator runtime libraries, excluding built-in support
for reset and exception vectors and tables.


=item B<-mtf>

Causes all functions to default to the C<.far> section.  Without
this option, functions default to the C<.near> section.


=item B<-mtiny=>I<n>

Variables that are I<n> bytes or smaller will be allocated to the
C<.tiny> section.  These variables use the C<$gp> base
register.  The default for this option is 4, but note that there's a
65536 byte limit to the C<.tiny> section.

=head3 MicroBlaze Options



=over 4



=item B<-msoft-float>

Use software emulation for floating point (default).


=item B<-mhard-float>

Use hardware floating point instructions.


=item B<-mmemcpy>

Do not optimize block moves, use C<memcpy>.


=item B<-mno-clearbss>

This option is deprecated.  Use B<-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss> instead.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu-type>

Use features of and schedule code for given CPU.
Supported values are in the format B<v>I<X>B<.>I<YY>B<.>I<Z>, 
where I<X> is a major version, I<YY> is the minor version, and 
I<Z> is compatibility code.  Example values are B<v3.00.a>,
B<v4.00.b>, B<v5.00.a>, B<v5.00.b>, B<v5.00.b>, B<v6.00.a>. 


=item B<-mxl-soft-mul>

Use software multiply emulation (default).


=item B<-mxl-soft-div>

Use software emulation for divides (default).


=item B<-mxl-barrel-shift>

=item B<-mxl-pattern-compare>

Use pattern compare instructions.


=item B<-msmall-divides>

Use table lookup optimization for small signed integer divisions.

Use multiply high instructions for high part of 32x32 multiply.


=item B<-mxl-float-convert>

Use hardware floating point conversion instructions.


=item B<-mxl-float-sqrt>

Use hardware floating point square root instruction.


=item B<-mxl-mode->I<app-model>

Select application model I<app-model>.  Valid models are 

=over 4


=item B<executable>

normal executable (default), uses startup code F<crt0.o>.


=item B<xmdstub>

for use with Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) based 
software intrusive debug agent called xmdstub. This uses startup file 
F<crt1.o> and sets the start address of the program to be 0x800.


=item B<bootstrap>

for applications that are loaded using a bootloader.
This model uses startup file F<crt2.o> which does not contain a processor 
reset vector handler. This is suitable for transferring control on a 
processor reset to the bootloader rather than the application.


=item B<novectors>

for applications that do not require any of the 
MicroBlaze vectors. This option may be useful for applications running
within a monitoring application. This model uses F<crt3.o> as a startup file.

Option B<-xl-mode->I<app-model> is a deprecated alias for 
B<-mxl-mode->I<app-model>.

=head3 MIPS Options



=over 4



=item B<-EB>

Generate big-endian code.


=item B<-EL>

Generate little-endian code.  This is the default for B<mips*el-*-*>
configurations.


=item B<-march=>I<arch>

Generate code that will run on I<arch>, which can be the name of a
generic MIPS ISA, or the name of a particular processor.
The ISA names are:
B<mips1>, B<mips2>, B<mips3>, B<mips4>,
B<mips32>, B<mips32r2>, B<mips64> and B<mips64r2>.
The processor names are:
B<4kc>, B<4km>, B<4kp>, B<4ksc>,
B<4kec>, B<4kem>, B<4kep>, B<4ksd>,
B<5kc>, B<5kf>,
B<20kc>,
B<24kc>, B<24kf2_1>, B<24kf1_1>,
B<24kec>, B<24kef2_1>, B<24kef1_1>,
B<34kc>, B<34kf2_1>, B<34kf1_1>,
B<74kc>, B<74kf2_1>, B<74kf1_1>, B<74kf3_2>,
B<1004kc>, B<1004kf2_1>, B<1004kf1_1>,
B<loongson2e>, B<loongson2f>, B<loongson3a>,
B<m4k>,
B<octeon>,
B<orion>,
B<r2000>, B<r3000>, B<r3900>, B<r4000>, B<r4400>,
B<r4600>, B<r4650>, B<r6000>, B<r8000>,
B<rm7000>, B<rm9000>,
B<r10000>, B<r12000>, B<r14000>, B<r16000>,
B<sb1>,
B<sr71000>,
B<vr4100>, B<vr4111>, B<vr4120>, B<vr4130>, B<vr4300>,
B<vr5000>, B<vr5400>, B<vr5500>
and B<xlr>.
The special value B<from-abi> selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is,
B<mips1> for 32-bit ABIs and B<mips3> for 64-bit ABIs).

Native Linux/GNU toolchains also support the value B<native>,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
B<-march=native> has no effect if GCC does not recognize
the processor.

In processor names, a final B<000> can be abbreviated as B<k>
(for example, B<-march=r2k>).  Prefixes are optional, and
B<vr> may be written B<r>.

Names of the form I<n>B<f2_1> refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
I<n>B<f1_1> refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form I<n>B<f3_2> refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, I<n>B<f> is accepted as a synonym
for I<n>B<f2_1> while I<n>B<x> and I<b>B<fx> are
accepted as synonyms for I<n>B<f1_1>.

GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is B<_MIPS_ARCH>, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form B<_MIPS_ARCH_>I<foo>,
where I<foo> is the capitalized value of B<_MIPS_ARCH>.
For example, B<-march=r2000> will set B<_MIPS_ARCH>
to B<"r2000"> and define the macro B<_MIPS_ARCH_R2000>.

Note that the B<_MIPS_ARCH> macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it will have the full prefix and will not
abbreviate B<000> as B<k>.  In the case of B<from-abi>,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either B<"mips1"> or
B<"mips3">).  It names the default architecture when no
B<-march> option is given.


=item B<-mtune=>I<arch>

Optimize for I<arch>.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of I<arch> values is the same as for
B<-march>.

When this option is not used, GCC will optimize for the processor
specified by B<-march>.  By using B<-march> and
B<-mtune> together, it is possible to generate code that will
run on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.

B<-mtune> defines the macros B<_MIPS_TUNE> and
B<_MIPS_TUNE_>I<foo>, which work in the same way as the
B<-march> ones described above.


=item B<-mips1>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips1>.


=item B<-mips2>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips2>.


=item B<-mips3>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips3>.


=item B<-mips4>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips4>.


=item B<-mips32>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips32>.


=item B<-mips32r2>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips32r2>.


=item B<-mips64>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips64>.


=item B<-mips64r2>

Equivalent to B<-march=mips64r2>.


=item B<-mips16>


=item B<-mno-mips16>

Generate (do not generate) MIPS16 code.  If GCC is targetting a
MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture, it will make use of the MIPS16e ASE.

MIPS16 code generation can also be controlled on a per-function basis
by means of C<mips16> and C<nomips16> attributes.



=item B<-mflip-mips16>

Generate MIPS16 code on alternating functions.  This option is provided
for regression testing of mixed MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code generation, and is
not intended for ordinary use in compiling user code.


=item B<-minterlink-mips16>


=item B<-mno-interlink-mips16>

Require (do not require) that non-MIPS16 code be link-compatible with
MIPS16 code.

For example, non-MIPS16 code cannot jump directly to MIPS16 code;
it must either use a call or an indirect jump.  B<-minterlink-mips16>
therefore disables direct jumps unless GCC knows that the target of the
jump is not MIPS16.


=item B<-mabi=32>


=item B<-mabi=o64>


=item B<-mabi=n32>


=item B<-mabi=64>


=item B<-mabi=eabi>

Generate code for the given ABI.

Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  GCC normally
generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you
can use B<-mgp32> to get 32-bit code instead.

For information about the O64 ABI, see
E<lt>B<http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html>E<gt>.

GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point registers
are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this combination with
B<-mabi=32> B<-mfp64>.  This ABI relies on the B<mthc1>
and B<mfhc1> instructions and is therefore only supported for
MIPS32R2 processors.

The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit register
rather than a pair of 32-bit registers.  For example, scalar
floating-point values are returned in B<$f0> only, not a
B<$f0>/B<$f1> pair.  The set of call-saved registers also
remains the same, but all 64 bits are saved.


=item B<-mabicalls>


=item B<-mno-abicalls>

Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for SVR4-style
dynamic objects.  B<-mabicalls> is the default for SVR4-based
systems.


=item B<-mshared>


=item B<-mno-shared>

Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent,
and that can therefore be linked into shared libraries.  This option
only affects B<-mabicalls>.

All B<-mabicalls> code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like B<-fPIC> and B<-fpic>.  However,
as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter GP
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by B<-mno-shared>.

B<-mno-shared> depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker.  However, the option
does not affect the ABI of the final executable; it only affects the ABI
of relocatable objects.  Using B<-mno-shared> will generally make
executables both smaller and quicker.

B<-mshared> is the default.


=item B<-mplt>


=item B<-mno-plt>

Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers
support PLTs and copy relocations.  This option only affects
B<-mno-shared -mabicalls>.  For the n64 ABI, this option
has no effect without B<-msym32>.

You can make B<-mplt> the default by configuring
GCC with B<--with-mips-plt>.  The default is
B<-mno-plt> otherwise.


=item B<-mxgot>


=item B<-mno-xgot>

Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global
offset table.

GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT.
While this is relatively efficient, it will only work if the GOT
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger will cause the linker
to report an error such as:

	
	relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar


If this happens, you should recompile your code with B<-mxgot>.
It should then work with very large GOTs, although it will also be
less efficient, since it will take three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.

Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use B<-mxgot> when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT entries.  Very few do.

These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position
independent code.


=item B<-mgp32>

Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.


=item B<-mgp64>

Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.


=item B<-mfp32>

Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.


=item B<-mfp64>

Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.


=item B<-mhard-float>

Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.


=item B<-msoft-float>

Do not use floating-point coprocessor instructions.  Implement
floating-point calculations using library calls instead.


=item B<-msingle-float>

Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports single-precision
operations.


=item B<-mdouble-float>

Assume that the floating-point coprocessor supports double-precision
operations.  This is the default.


=item B<-mllsc>


=item B<-mno-llsc>

Use (do not use) B<ll>, B<sc>, and B<sync> instructions to
implement atomic memory built-in functions.  When neither option is
specified, GCC will use the instructions if the target architecture
supports them.

B<-mllsc> is useful if the runtime environment can emulate the
instructions and B<-mno-llsc> can be useful when compiling for
nonstandard ISAs.  You can make either option the default by
configuring GCC with B<--with-llsc> and B<--without-llsc>
respectively.  B<--with-llsc> is the default for some
configurations; see the installation documentation for details.


=item B<-mdsp>


=item B<-mno-dsp>

Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS DSP ASE.
  This option defines the
preprocessor macro B<__mips_dsp>.  It also defines
B<__mips_dsp_rev> to 1.


=item B<-mdspr2>


=item B<-mno-dspr2>

Use (do not use) revision 2 of the MIPS DSP ASE.
  This option defines the
preprocessor macros B<__mips_dsp> and B<__mips_dspr2>.
It also defines B<__mips_dsp_rev> to 2.


=item B<-msmartmips>


=item B<-mno-smartmips>

Use (do not use) the MIPS SmartMIPS ASE.


=item B<-mpaired-single>


=item B<-mno-paired-single>

Use (do not use) paired-single floating-point instructions.
  This option requires
hardware floating-point support to be enabled.


=item B<-mdmx>


=item B<-mno-mdmx>

Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media Extension instructions.
This option can only be used when generating 64-bit code and requires
hardware floating-point support to be enabled.


=item B<-mips3d>


=item B<-mno-mips3d>

Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE.  
The option B<-mips3d> implies B<-mpaired-single>.


=item B<-mmt>


=item B<-mno-mt>

Use (do not use) MT Multithreading instructions.


=item B<-mlong64>

Force C<long> types to be 64 bits wide.  See B<-mlong32> for
an explanation of the default and the way that the pointer size is
determined.


=item B<-mlong32>

Force C<long>, C<int>, and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.

The default size of C<int>s, C<long>s and pointers depends on
the ABI.  All the supported ABIs use 32-bit C<int>s.  The n64 ABI
uses 64-bit C<long>s, as does the 64-bit EABI; the others use
32-bit C<long>s.  Pointers are the same size as C<long>s,
or the same size as integer registers, whichever is smaller.


=item B<-msym32>


=item B<-mno-sym32>

Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values, regardless
of the selected ABI.  This option is useful in combination with
B<-mabi=64> and B<-mno-abicalls> because it allows GCC
to generate shorter and faster references to symbolic addresses.


=item B<-G> I<num>

Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data section
if that data is no bigger than I<num> bytes.  GCC can then access
the data more efficiently; see B<-mgpopt> for details.

The default B<-G> option depends on the configuration.


=item B<-mlocal-sdata>


=item B<-mno-local-sdata>

Extend (do not extend) the B<-G> behavior to local data too,
such as to static variables in C.  B<-mlocal-sdata> is the
default for all configurations.

If the linker complains that an application is using too much small data,
you might want to try rebuilding the less performance-critical parts with
B<-mno-local-sdata>.  You might also want to build large
libraries with B<-mno-local-sdata>, so that the libraries leave
more room for the main program.


=item B<-mextern-sdata>


=item B<-mno-extern-sdata>

Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data will be in
a small data section if that data is within the B<-G> limit.
B<-mextern-sdata> is the default for all configurations.

If you compile a module I<Mod> with B<-mextern-sdata> B<-G>
I<num> B<-mgpopt>, and I<Mod> references a variable I<Var>
that is no bigger than I<num> bytes, you must make sure that I<Var>
is placed in a small data section.  If I<Var> is defined by another
module, you must either compile that module with a high-enough
B<-G> setting or attach a C<section> attribute to I<Var>'s
definition.  If I<Var> is common, you must link the application
with a high-enough B<-G> setting.

The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to compile
and link every module with the same B<-G> option.  However,
you may wish to build a library that supports several different
small data limits.  You can do this by compiling the library with
the highest supported B<-G> setting and additionally using
B<-mno-extern-sdata> to stop the library from making assumptions
about externally-defined data.


=item B<-mgpopt>


=item B<-mno-gpopt>

Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are known to be
in a small data section; see B<-G>, B<-mlocal-sdata> and
B<-mextern-sdata>.  B<-mgpopt> is the default for all
configurations.

B<-mno-gpopt> is useful for cases where the C<$gp> register
might not hold the value of C<_gp>.  For example, if the code is
part of a library that might be used in a boot monitor, programs that
call boot monitor routines will pass an unknown value in C<$gp>.
(In such situations, the boot monitor itself would usually be compiled
with B<-G0>.)

B<-mno-gpopt> implies B<-mno-local-sdata> and
B<-mno-extern-sdata>.


=item B<-membedded-data>


=item B<-mno-embedded-data>

Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible, then
next in the small data section if possible, otherwise in data.  This gives
slightly slower code than the default, but reduces the amount of RAM required
when executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded systems.


=item B<-muninit-const-in-rodata>


=item B<-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata>

Put uninitialized C<const> variables in the read-only data section.
This option is only meaningful in conjunction with B<-membedded-data>.


=item B<-mcode-readable=>I<setting>

Specify whether GCC may generate code that reads from executable sections.
There are three possible settings:


=over 4


=item B<-mcode-readable=yes>

Instructions may freely access executable sections.  This is the
default setting.


=item B<-mcode-readable=pcrel>

MIPS16 PC-relative load instructions can access executable sections,
but other instructions must not do so.  This option is useful on 4KSc
and 4KSd processors when the code TLBs have the Read Inhibit bit set.
It is also useful on processors that can be configured to have a dual
instruction/data SRAM interface and that, like the M4K, automatically
redirect PC-relative loads to the instruction RAM.


=item B<-mcode-readable=no>

Instructions must not access executable sections.  This option can be
useful on targets that are configured to have a dual instruction/data
SRAM interface but that (unlike the M4K) do not automatically redirect
PC-relative loads to the instruction RAM.

=back



=item B<-msplit-addresses>


=item B<-mno-split-addresses>

Enable (disable) use of the C<%hi()> and C<%lo()> assembler
relocation operators.  This option has been superseded by
B<-mexplicit-relocs> but is retained for backwards compatibility.


=item B<-mexplicit-relocs>


=item B<-mno-explicit-relocs>

Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing with symbolic
addresses.  The alternative, selected by B<-mno-explicit-relocs>,
is to use assembler macros instead.

B<-mexplicit-relocs> is the default if GCC was configured
to use an assembler that supports relocation operators.


=item B<-mcheck-zero-division>


=item B<-mno-check-zero-division>

Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.

The default is B<-mcheck-zero-division>.


=item B<-mdivide-traps>


=item B<-mdivide-breaks>

MIPS systems check for division by zero by generating either a
conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using traps results in
smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and later.  Also, some
versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that prevents trap from
generating the proper signal (C<SIGFPE>).  Use B<-mdivide-traps> to
allow conditional traps on architectures that support them and
B<-mdivide-breaks> to force the use of breaks.

The default is usually B<-mdivide-traps>, but this can be
overridden at configure time using B<--with-divide=breaks>.
Divide-by-zero checks can be completely disabled using
B<-mno-check-zero-division>.


=item B<-mmemcpy>


=item B<-mno-memcpy>

Force (do not force) the use of C<memcpy()> for non-trivial block
moves.  The default is B<-mno-memcpy>, which allows GCC to inline
most constant-sized copies.


=item B<-mlong-calls>


=item B<-mno-long-calls>

Disable (do not disable) use of the C<jal> instruction.  Calling
functions using C<jal> is more efficient but requires the caller
and callee to be in the same 256 megabyte segment.

This option has no effect on abicalls code.  The default is
B<-mno-long-calls>.


=item B<-mmad>


=item B<-mno-mad>

Enable (disable) use of the C<mad>, C<madu> and C<mul>
instructions, as provided by the R4650 ISA.


=item B<-mfused-madd>


=item B<-mno-fused-madd>

Enable (disable) use of the floating point multiply-accumulate
instructions, when they are available.  The default is
B<-mfused-madd>.

When multiply-accumulate instructions are used, the intermediate
product is calculated to infinite precision and is not subject to
the FCSR Flush to Zero bit.  This may be undesirable in some
circumstances.


=item B<-nocpp>

Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user
assembler files (with a B<.s> suffix) when assembling them.


=item B<-mfix-r4000>


=item B<-mno-fix-r4000>

Work around certain R4000 CPU errata:

=over 4


=item -

A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect result if executed
immediately after starting an integer division.

=item -

A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect result if executed
while an integer multiplication is in progress.

=item -

An integer division may give an incorrect result if started in a delay slot
of a taken branch or a jump.

=back



=item B<-mfix-r4400>


=item B<-mno-fix-r4400>

Work around certain R4400 CPU errata:

=over 4


=item -

A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect result if executed
immediately after starting an integer division.

=back



=item B<-mfix-r10000>


=item B<-mno-fix-r10000>

Work around certain R10000 errata:

=over 4


=item -

C<ll>/C<sc> sequences may not behave atomically on revisions
prior to 3.0.  They may deadlock on revisions 2.6 and earlier.

=back


This option can only be used if the target architecture supports
branch-likely instructions.  B<-mfix-r10000> is the default when
B<-march=r10000> is used; B<-mno-fix-r10000> is the default
otherwise.


=item B<-mfix-vr4120>


=item B<-mno-fix-vr4120>

Work around certain VR4120 errata:

=over 4


=item -

C<dmultu> does not always produce the correct result.

=item -

C<div> and C<ddiv> do not always produce the correct result if one
of the operands is negative.

=back

The workarounds for the division errata rely on special functions in
F<libgcc.a>.  At present, these functions are only provided by
the C<mips64vr*-elf> configurations.

Other VR4120 errata require a nop to be inserted between certain pairs of
instructions.  These errata are handled by the assembler, not by GCC itself.


=item B<-mfix-vr4130>

Work around the VR4130 C<mflo>/C<mfhi> errata.  The
workarounds are implemented by the assembler rather than by GCC,
although GCC will avoid using C<mflo> and C<mfhi> if the
VR4130 C<macc>, C<macchi>, C<dmacc> and C<dmacchi>
instructions are available instead.


=item B<-mfix-sb1>


=item B<-mno-fix-sb1>

Work around certain SB-1 CPU core errata.
(This flag currently works around the SB-1 revision 2
"F1" and "F2" floating point errata.)


=item B<-mr10k-cache-barrier=>I<setting>

Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.

In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the "taken" branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome was wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.

This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a DMA operation writes to the
same area of memory before the "dirty" line is flushed, the cached
data will overwrite the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.

One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  B<-mr10k-cache-barrier=>I<setting>
controls GCC's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions will not have
side effects:


=over 4


=item 1.

the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;


=item 2.

the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;


=item 3.

the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.

=back


It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.

If the input program contains a function declaration such as:

	
	void foo (void);


then the implementation of C<foo> must allow C<j foo> and
C<jal foo> to be executed speculatively.  GCC honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.

The option has three forms:


=over 4


=item B<-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store>

Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.


=item B<-mr10k-cache-barrier=store>

Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be speculatively
executed and that might have side effects even if aborted.


=item B<-mr10k-cache-barrier=none>

Disable the insertion of cache barriers.  This is the default setting.

=back



=item B<-mflush-func=>I<func>


=item B<-mno-flush-func>

Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches, or to not
call any such function.  If called, the function must take the same
arguments as the common C<_flush_func()>, that is, the address of the
memory range for which the cache is being flushed, the size of the
memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both caches).  The default
depends on the target GCC was configured for, but commonly is either
B<_flush_func> or B<__cpu_flush>.


=item B<mbranch-cost=>I<num>

Set the cost of branches to roughly I<num> "simple" instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.  A zero cost redundantly selects
the default, which is based on the B<-mtune> setting.


=item B<-mbranch-likely>


=item B<-mno-branch-likely>

Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions, regardless of the
default for the selected architecture.  By default, Branch Likely
instructions may be generated if they are supported by the selected
architecture.  An exception is for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures
and processors which implement those architectures; for those, Branch
Likely instructions will not be generated by default because the MIPS32
and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate their use.


=item B<-mfp-exceptions>


=item B<-mno-fp-exceptions>

Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled.  This affects how we schedule
FP instructions for some processors.  The default is that FP exceptions are
enabled.

For instance, on the SB-1, if FP exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting
64-bit code, then we can use both FP pipes.  Otherwise, we can only use one
FP pipe.


=item B<-mvr4130-align>


=item B<-mno-vr4130-align>

The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only issue two
instructions together if the first one is 8-byte aligned.  When this
option is enabled, GCC will align pairs of instructions that it
thinks should execute in parallel.

This option only has an effect when optimizing for the VR4130.
It normally makes code faster, but at the expense of making it bigger.
It is enabled by default at optimization level B<-O3>.


=item B<-msynci>


=item B<-mno-synci>

Enable (disable) generation of C<synci> instructions on
architectures that support it.  The C<synci> instructions (if
enabled) will be generated when C<__builtin___clear_cache()> is
compiled.

This option defaults to C<-mno-synci>, but the default can be
overridden by configuring with C<--with-synci>.

When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally safe
to use C<synci>.  However, on many multi-core (SMP) systems, it
will not invalidate the instruction caches on all cores and may lead
to undefined behavior.


=item B<-mrelax-pic-calls>


=item B<-mno-relax-pic-calls>

Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via register
C<$25> into direct calls.  This is only possible if the linker can
resolve the destination at link-time and if the destination is within
range for a direct call.

B<-mrelax-pic-calls> is the default if GCC was configured to use
an assembler and a linker that supports the C<.reloc> assembly
directive and C<-mexplicit-relocs> is in effect.  With
C<-mno-explicit-relocs>, this optimization can be performed by the
assembler and the linker alone without help from the compiler.


=item B<-mmcount-ra-address>


=item B<-mno-mcount-ra-address>

Emit (do not emit) code that allows C<_mcount> to modify the
calling function's return address.  When enabled, this option extends
the usual C<_mcount> interface with a new I<ra-address>
parameter, which has type C<intptr_t *> and is passed in register
C<$12>.  C<_mcount> can then modify the return address by
doing both of the following:

=over 4


=item *

Returning the new address in register C<$31>.

=item *

Storing the new address in C<*I<ra-address>>,
if I<ra-address> is nonnull.

=back


The default is B<-mno-mcount-ra-address>.


=back



=head3 MMIX Options


These options are defined for the MMIX:


=over 4


=item B<-mlibfuncs>


=item B<-mno-libfuncs>

Specify that intrinsic library functions are being compiled, passing all
values in registers, no matter the size.


=item B<-mepsilon>


=item B<-mno-epsilon>

Generate floating-point comparison instructions that compare with respect
to the C<rE> epsilon register.


=item B<-mabi=mmixware>


=item B<-mabi=gnu>

Generate code that passes function parameters and return values that (in
the called function) are seen as registers C<$0> and up, as opposed to
the GNU ABI which uses global registers C<$231> and up.


=item B<-mzero-extend>


=item B<-mno-zero-extend>

When reading data from memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits, use (do not
use) zero-extending load instructions by default, rather than
sign-extending ones.


=item B<-mknuthdiv>


=item B<-mno-knuthdiv>

Make the result of a division yielding a remainder have the same sign as
the divisor.  With the default, B<-mno-knuthdiv>, the sign of the
remainder follows the sign of the dividend.  Both methods are
arithmetically valid, the latter being almost exclusively used.


=item B<-mtoplevel-symbols>


=item B<-mno-toplevel-symbols>

Prepend (do not prepend) a B<:> to all global symbols, so the assembly
code can be used with the C<PREFIX> assembly directive.


=item B<-melf>

Generate an executable in the ELF format, rather than the default
B<mmo> format used by the B<mmix> simulator.


=item B<-mbranch-predict>


=item B<-mno-branch-predict>

Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when static branch
prediction indicates a probable branch.


=item B<-mbase-addresses>


=item B<-mno-base-addresses>

Generate (do not generate) code that uses I<base addresses>.  Using a
base address automatically generates a request (handled by the assembler
and the linker) for a constant to be set up in a global register.  The
register is used for one or more base address requests within the range 0
to 255 from the value held in the register.  The generally leads to short
and fast code, but the number of different data items that can be
addressed is limited.  This means that a program that uses lots of static
data may require B<-mno-base-addresses>.


=item B<-msingle-exit>


=item B<-mno-single-exit>

Force (do not force) generated code to have a single exit point in each
function.

=back



=head3 MN10300 Options


These B<-m> options are defined for Matsushita MN10300 architectures:


=over 4


=item B<-mmult-bug>

Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the MN10300
processors.  This is the default.


=item B<-mno-mult-bug>

Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the
MN10300 processors.


=item B<-mam33>

Generate code which uses features specific to the AM33 processor.


=item B<-mno-am33>

Do not generate code which uses features specific to the AM33 processor.  This
is the default.


=item B<-mam33-2>

Generate code which uses features specific to the AM33/2.0 processor.


=item B<-mam34>

Generate code which uses features specific to the AM34 processor.


=item B<-mtune=>I<cpu-type>

Use the timing characteristics of the indicated CPU type when
scheduling instructions.  This does not change the targeted processor
type.  The CPU type must be one of B<mn10300>, B<am33>,
B<am33-2> or B<am34>.


=item B<-mreturn-pointer-on-d0>

When generating a function which returns a pointer, return the pointer
in both C<a0> and C<d0>.  Otherwise, the pointer is returned
only in a0, and attempts to call such functions without a prototype
would result in errors.  Note that this option is on by default; use
B<-mno-return-pointer-on-d0> to disable it.


=item B<-mno-crt0>

Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.


=item B<-mrelax>

Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation optimization pass
to shorten branches, calls and absolute memory addresses.  This option only
has an effect when used on the command line for the final link step.

This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.


=item B<-mliw>

Allow the compiler to generate I<Long Instruction Word>
instructions if the target is the B<AM33> or later.  This is the
default.  This option defines the preprocessor macro B<__LIW__>.


=item B<-mnoliw>

Do not allow the compiler to generate I<Long Instruction Word>
instructions.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
B<__NO_LIW__>.


=back



=head3 PDP-11 Options


These options are defined for the PDP-11:


=over 4


=item B<-mfpu>

Use hardware FPP floating point.  This is the default.  (FIS floating
point on the PDP-11/40 is not supported.)


=item B<-msoft-float>

Do not use hardware floating point.


=item B<-mac0>

Return floating-point results in ac0 (fr0 in Unix assembler syntax).


=item B<-mno-ac0>

Return floating-point results in memory.  This is the default.


=item B<-m40>

Generate code for a PDP-11/40.


=item B<-m45>

Generate code for a PDP-11/45.  This is the default.


=item B<-m10>

Generate code for a PDP-11/10.


=item B<-mbcopy-builtin>

Use inline C<movmemhi> patterns for copying memory.  This is the
default.


=item B<-mbcopy>

Do not use inline C<movmemhi> patterns for copying memory.


=item B<-mint16>


=item B<-mno-int32>

Use 16-bit C<int>.  This is the default.


=item B<-mint32>


=item B<-mno-int16>

Use 32-bit C<int>.


=item B<-mfloat64>


=item B<-mno-float32>

Use 64-bit C<float>.  This is the default.


=item B<-mfloat32>


=item B<-mno-float64>

Use 32-bit C<float>.


=item B<-mabshi>

Use C<abshi2> pattern.  This is the default.


=item B<-mno-abshi>

Do not use C<abshi2> pattern.


=item B<-mbranch-expensive>

Pretend that branches are expensive.  This is for experimenting with
code generation only.


=item B<-mbranch-cheap>

Do not pretend that branches are expensive.  This is the default.


=item B<-munix-asm>

Use Unix assembler syntax.  This is the default when configured for
B<pdp11-*-bsd>.


=item B<-mdec-asm>

Use DEC assembler syntax.  This is the default when configured for any
PDP-11 target other than B<pdp11-*-bsd>.

=back



=head3 picoChip Options


These B<-m> options are defined for picoChip implementations:


=over 4



=item B<-mae=>I<ae_type>

Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for array element type I<ae_type>.  Supported values
for I<ae_type> are B<ANY>, B<MUL>, and B<MAC>.

B<-mae=ANY> selects a completely generic AE type.  Code
generated with this option will run on any of the other AE types.  The
code will not be as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific
AE type, and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) will not
work properly on all types of AE.

B<-mae=MUL> selects a MUL AE type.  This is the most useful AE type
for compiled code, and is the default.

B<-mae=MAC> selects a DSP-style MAC AE.  Code compiled with this
option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char) manipulation,
since the DSP AE does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.


=item B<-msymbol-as-address>

Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a
load/store instruction, without first loading it into a
register.  Typically, the use of this option will generate larger
programs, which run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the
results vary from program to program, so it is left as a user option,
rather than being permanently enabled.


=item B<-mno-inefficient-warnings>

Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code which
performs byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE type.  The MAC AE has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning will be generated indicating to the programmer
that they should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an AE type which has the necessary hardware support.  This option enables
the warning to be turned off.


=back



=head3 PowerPC Options


These are listed under 


=head3 IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:

=item B<-mno-mfpgpr>


=item B<-mhard-dfp>


=item B<-mno-hard-dfp>

GCC supports two related instruction set architectures for the
RS/6000 and PowerPC.  The I<POWER> instruction set are those
instructions supported by the B<rios> chip set used in the original
RS/6000 systems and the I<PowerPC> instruction set is the
architecture of the Freescale MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the IBM 4xx, 6xx, and follow-on microprocessors.

Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An MQ
register is included in processors supporting the POWER architecture.

You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type> option
rather than the options listed above.

The B<-mpower> option allows GCC to generate instructions that
are found only in the POWER architecture and to use the MQ register.
Specifying B<-mpower2> implies B<-power> and also allows GCC
to generate instructions that are present in the POWER2 architecture but
not the original POWER architecture.

The B<-mpowerpc> option allows GCC to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
Specifying B<-mpowerpc-gpopt> implies B<-mpowerpc> and also allows
GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
B<-mpowerpc-gfxopt> implies B<-mpowerpc> and also allows GCC to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.

The B<-mmfcrf> option allows GCC to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the POWER4
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture.
The B<-mpopcntb> option allows GCC to generate the popcount and
double precision FP reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on the
POWER5 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture.
The B<-mpopcntd> option allows GCC to generate the popcount
instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.
The B<-mfprnd> option allows GCC to generate the FP round to
integer instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.
The B<-mcmpb> option allows GCC to generate the compare bytes
instruction implemented on the POWER6 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.
The B<-mmfpgpr> option allows GCC to generate the FP move to/from
general purpose register instructions implemented on the POWER6X
processor and other processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05
architecture.
The B<-mhard-dfp> option allows GCC to generate the decimal floating
point instructions implemented on some POWER processors.

The B<-mpowerpc64> option allows GCC to generate the additional
64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  GCC defaults to
B<-mno-powerpc64>.

If you specify both B<-mno-power> and B<-mno-powerpc>, GCC
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will not use
the MQ register.  Specifying both B<-mpower> and B<-mpowerpc>
permits GCC to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the MQ register; specify this for the Motorola MPC601.


=item B<-mnew-mnemonics>


=item B<-mold-mnemonics>

Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.  With
B<-mnew-mnemonics>, GCC uses the assembler mnemonics defined for
the PowerPC architecture.  With B<-mold-mnemonics> it uses the
assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER architecture.  Instructions
defined in only one architecture have only one mnemonic; GCC uses that
mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is specified.

GCC defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
use.  Specifying B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type> sometimes overrides the
value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
should normally not specify either B<-mnew-mnemonics> or
B<-mold-mnemonics>, but should instead accept the default.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type>

Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and
instruction scheduling parameters for machine type I<cpu_type>.
Supported values for I<cpu_type> are B<401>, B<403>,
B<405>, B<405fp>, B<440>, B<440fp>, B<464>, B<464fp>,
B<476>, B<476fp>, B<505>, B<601>, B<602>, B<603>,
B<603e>, B<604>, B<604e>, B<620>, B<630>, B<740>,
B<7400>, B<7450>, B<750>, B<801>, B<821>, B<823>,
B<860>, B<970>, B<8540>, B<a2>, B<e300c2>,
B<e300c3>, B<e500mc>, B<e500mc64>, B<ec603e>, B<G3>,
B<G4>, B<G5>, B<titan>, B<power>, B<power2>, B<power3>,
B<power4>, B<power5>, B<power5+>, B<power6>, B<power6x>,
B<power7>, B<common>, B<powerpc>, B<powerpc64>, B<rios>,
B<rios1>, B<rios2>, B<rsc>, and B<rs64>.

B<-mcpu=common> selects a completely generic processor.  Code
generated under this option will run on any POWER or PowerPC processor.
GCC will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures, and will not use the MQ register.  GCC assumes a generic
processor model for scheduling purposes.

B<-mcpu=power>, B<-mcpu=power2>, B<-mcpu=powerpc>, and
B<-mcpu=powerpc64> specify generic POWER, POWER2, pure 32-bit
PowerPC (i.e., not MPC601), and 64-bit PowerPC architecture machine
types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed for
scheduling purposes.

The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under
those options will run best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.

The B<-mcpu> options automatically enable or disable the
following options:

B<-maltivec  -mfprnd  -mhard-float  -mmfcrf  -mmultiple 
-mnew-mnemonics  -mpopcntb -mpopcntd  -mpower  -mpower2  -mpowerpc64 
-mpowerpc-gpopt  -mpowerpc-gfxopt  -msingle-float -mdouble-float 
-msimple-fpu -mstring  -mmulhw  -mdlmzb  -mmfpgpr -mvsx>

The particular options set for any particular CPU will vary between
compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to produce optimal
code for that CPU; it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual hardware's
capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual option to a particular
value, you may specify it after the B<-mcpu> option, like
B<-mcpu=970 -mno-altivec>.

On AIX, the B<-maltivec> and B<-mpowerpc64> options are
not enabled or disabled by the B<-mcpu> option at present because
AIX does not have full support for these options.  You may still
enable or disable them individually if you're sure it'll work in your
environment.


=item B<-mtune=>I<cpu_type>

Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
I<cpu_type>, but do not set the architecture type, register usage, or
choice of mnemonics, as B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type> would.  The same
values for I<cpu_type> are used for B<-mtune> as for
B<-mcpu>.  If both are specified, the code generated will use the
architecture, registers, and mnemonics set by B<-mcpu>, but the
scheduling parameters set by B<-mtune>.


=item B<-mcmodel=small>

Generate PowerPC64 code for the small model: The TOC is limited to
64k.


=item B<-mcmodel=medium>

Generate PowerPC64 code for the medium model: The TOC and other static
data may be up to a total of 4G in size.


=item B<-mcmodel=large>

Generate PowerPC64 code for the large model: The TOC may be up to 4G
in size.  Other data and code is only limited by the 64-bit address
space.


=item B<-maltivec>


=item B<-mno-altivec>

Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions, and also
enable the use of built-in functions that allow more direct access to
the AltiVec instruction set.  You may also need to set
B<-mabi=altivec> to adjust the current ABI with AltiVec ABI
enhancements.


=item B<-mvrsave>


=item B<-mno-vrsave>

Generate VRSAVE instructions when generating AltiVec code.


=item B<-mgen-cell-microcode>

Generate Cell microcode instructions


=item B<-mwarn-cell-microcode>

Warning when a Cell microcode instruction is going to emitted.  An example
of a Cell microcode instruction is a variable shift.


=item B<-msecure-plt>

Generate code that allows ld and ld.so to build executables and shared
libraries with non-exec .plt and .got sections.  This is a PowerPC
32-bit SYSV ABI option.


=item B<-mbss-plt>

Generate code that uses a BSS .plt section that ld.so fills in, and
requires .plt and .got sections that are both writable and executable.
This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.


=item B<-misel>


=item B<-mno-isel>

This switch enables or disables the generation of ISEL instructions.


=item B<-misel=>I<yes/no>

This switch has been deprecated.  Use B<-misel> and
B<-mno-isel> instead.


=item B<-mspe>


=item B<-mno-spe>

This switch enables or disables the generation of SPE simd
instructions.


=item B<-mpaired>


=item B<-mno-paired>

This switch enables or disables the generation of PAIRED simd
instructions.


=item B<-mspe=>I<yes/no>

This option has been deprecated.  Use B<-mspe> and
B<-mno-spe> instead.


=item B<-mvsx>


=item B<-mno-vsx>

Generate code that uses (does not use) vector/scalar (VSX)
instructions, and also enable the use of built-in functions that allow
more direct access to the VSX instruction set.


=item B<-mfloat-gprs=>I<yes/single/double/no>


=item B<-mfloat-gprs>

This switch enables or disables the generation of floating point
operations on the general purpose registers for architectures that
support it.

The argument I<yes> or I<single> enables the use of
single-precision floating point operations.

The argument I<double> enables the use of single and
double-precision floating point operations.

The argument I<no> disables floating point operations on the
general purpose registers.

This option is currently only available on the MPC854x.


=item B<-m32>


=item B<-m64>

Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and SVR4
targets (including GNU/Linux).  The 32-bit environment sets int, long
and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any PowerPC
variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and
pointer to 64 bits, and generates code for PowerPC64, as for
B<-mpowerpc64>.


=item B<-mfull-toc>


=item B<-mno-fp-in-toc>


=item B<-mno-sum-in-toc>


=item B<-mminimal-toc>

Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The B<-mfull-toc> option is selected by
default.  In that case, GCC will allocate at least one TOC entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC
will also place floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used
with the B<-mno-fp-in-toc> and B<-mno-sum-in-toc> options.
B<-mno-fp-in-toc> prevents GCC from putting floating-point
constants in the TOC and B<-mno-sum-in-toc> forces GCC to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both of
these options, specify B<-mminimal-toc> instead.  This option causes
GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, GCC will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently executed code.


=item B<-maix64>


=item B<-maix32>

Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit pointers, 64-bit
C<long> type, and the infrastructure needed to support them.
Specifying B<-maix64> implies B<-mpowerpc64> and
B<-mpowerpc>, while B<-maix32> disables the 64-bit ABI and
implies B<-mno-powerpc64>.  GCC defaults to B<-maix32>.


=item B<-mxl-compat>


=item B<-mno-xl-compat>

Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler semantics
when using AIX-compatible ABI.  Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on the stack
in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant
double in 128-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use XL symbol names for long double
support routines.

The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  IBM XL
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by IBM
XL compilers without optimization.


=item B<-mpe>

Support I<IBM RS/6000 SP> I<Parallel Environment> (PE).  Link an
application written to use message passing with special startup code to
enable the application to run.  The system must have PE installed in the
standard location (F</usr/lpp/ppe.poe/>), or the F<specs> file
must be overridden with the B<-specs=> option to specify the
appropriate directory location.  The Parallel Environment does not
support threads, so the B<-mpe> option and the B<-pthread>
option are incompatible.


=item B<-malign-natural>


=item B<-malign-power>

On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option
B<-malign-natural> overrides the ABI-defined alignment of larger
types, such as floating-point doubles, on their natural size-based boundary.
The option B<-malign-power> instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified
alignment rules.  GCC defaults to the standard alignment defined in the ABI.

On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and B<-malign-power>
is not supported.


=item B<-msoft-float>


=item B<-mhard-float>

Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set.
Software floating point emulation is provided if you use the
B<-msoft-float> option, and pass the option to GCC when linking.


=item B<-msingle-float>


=item B<-mdouble-float>

Generate code for single or double-precision floating point operations.
B<-mdouble-float> implies B<-msingle-float>.


=item B<-msimple-fpu>

Do not generate sqrt and div instructions for hardware floating point unit.


=item B<-mfpu>

Specify type of floating point unit.  Valid values are I<sp_lite>
(equivalent to -msingle-float -msimple-fpu), I<dp_lite> (equivalent
to -mdouble-float -msimple-fpu), I<sp_full> (equivalent to -msingle-float),
and I<dp_full> (equivalent to -mdouble-float).


=item B<-mxilinx-fpu>

Perform optimizations for floating point unit on Xilinx PPC 405/440.


=item B<-mmultiple>


=item B<-mno-multiple>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use B<-mmultiple> on little
endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and
PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in little endian mode.


=item B<-mstring>


=item B<-mno-string>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions
and the store string word instructions to save multiple registers and
do small block moves.  These instructions are generated by default on
POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use
B<-mstring> on little endian PowerPC systems, since those
instructions do not work when the processor is in little endian mode.
The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the instructions
usage in little endian mode.


=item B<-mupdate>


=item B<-mno-update>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
B<-mno-update>, there is a small window between the time that the
stack pointer is updated and the address of the previous frame is
stored, which means code that walks the stack frame across interrupts or
signals may get corrupted data.


=item B<-mavoid-indexed-addresses>


=item B<-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses>

Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of indexed load
or store instructions. These instructions can incur a performance
penalty on Power6 processors in certain situations, such as when
stepping through large arrays that cross a 16M boundary.  This option
is enabled by default when targetting Power6 and disabled otherwise.


=item B<-mfused-madd>


=item B<-mno-fused-madd>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default
if hardware floating point is used.  The machine dependent
B<-mfused-madd> option is now mapped to the machine independent
B<-ffp-contract=fast> option, and B<-mno-fused-madd> is
mapped to B<-ffp-contract=off>.


=item B<-mmulhw>


=item B<-mno-mulhw>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply and
multiply-accumulate instructions on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476 processors.
These instructions are generated by default when targetting those
processors.


=item B<-mdlmzb>


=item B<-mno-dlmzb>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search B<dlmzb>
instruction on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476 processors.  This instruction is
generated by default when targetting those processors.


=item B<-mno-bit-align>


=item B<-mbit-align>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures
and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned to the base type of the
bit-field.

For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
C<unsigned> bit-fields of length 1 would be aligned to a 4 byte
boundary and have a size of 4 bytes.  By using B<-mno-bit-align>,
the structure would be aligned to a 1 byte boundary and be one byte in
size.


=item B<-mno-strict-align>


=item B<-mstrict-align>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
unaligned memory references will be handled by the system.


=item B<-mrelocatable>


=item B<-mno-relocatable>

Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static executable to be
relocated to a different address at runtime.  A simple embedded
PowerPC system loader should relocate the entire contents of
C<.got2> and 4-byte locations listed in the C<.fixup> section,
a table of 32-bit addresses generated by this option.  For this to
work, all objects linked together must be compiled with
B<-mrelocatable> or B<-mrelocatable-lib>.
B<-mrelocatable> code aligns the stack to an 8 byte boundary.


=item B<-mrelocatable-lib>


=item B<-mno-relocatable-lib>

Like B<-mrelocatable>, B<-mrelocatable-lib> generates a
C<.fixup> section to allow static executables to be relocated at
runtime, but B<-mrelocatable-lib> does not use the smaller stack
alignment of B<-mrelocatable>.  Objects compiled with
B<-mrelocatable-lib> may be linked with objects compiled with
any combination of the B<-mrelocatable> options.


=item B<-mno-toc>


=item B<-mtoc>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
register 2 contains a pointer to a global area pointing to the addresses
used in the program.


=item B<-mlittle>


=item B<-mlittle-endian>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
processor in little endian mode.  The B<-mlittle-endian> option is
the same as B<-mlittle>.


=item B<-mbig>


=item B<-mbig-endian>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
processor in big endian mode.  The B<-mbig-endian> option is
the same as B<-mbig>.


=item B<-mdynamic-no-pic>

On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is not
relocatable, but that its external references are relocatable.  The
resulting code is suitable for applications, but not shared
libraries.


=item B<-msingle-pic-base>

Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.


=item B<-mprioritize-restricted-insns=>I<priority>

This option controls the priority that is assigned to
dispatch-slot restricted instructions during the second scheduling
pass.  The argument I<priority> takes the value I<0/1/2> to assign
I<no/highest/second-highest> priority to dispatch slot restricted
instructions.


=item B<-msched-costly-dep=>I<dependence_type>

This option controls which dependences are considered costly
by the target during instruction scheduling.  The argument
I<dependence_type> takes one of the following values:
I<no>: no dependence is costly,
I<all>: all dependences are costly,
I<true_store_to_load>: a true dependence from store to load is costly,
I<store_to_load>: any dependence from store to load is costly,
I<number>: any dependence which latency E<gt>= I<number> is costly.


=item B<-minsert-sched-nops=>I<scheme>

This option controls which nop insertion scheme will be used during
the second scheduling pass.  The argument I<scheme> takes one of the
following values:
I<no>: Don't insert nops.
I<pad>: Pad with nops any dispatch group which has vacant issue slots,
according to the scheduler's grouping.
I<regroup_exact>: Insert nops to force costly dependent insns into
separate groups.  Insert exactly as many nops as needed to force an insn
to a new group, according to the estimated processor grouping.
I<number>: Insert nops to force costly dependent insns into
separate groups.  Insert I<number> nops to force an insn to a new group.


=item B<-mcall-sysv>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using calling
conventions that adheres to the March 1995 draft of the System V
Application Binary Interface, PowerPC processor supplement.  This is the
default unless you configured GCC using B<powerpc-*-eabiaix>.


=item B<-mcall-sysv-eabi>


=item B<-mcall-eabi>

Specify both B<-mcall-sysv> and B<-meabi> options.


=item B<-mcall-sysv-noeabi>

Specify both B<-mcall-sysv> and B<-mno-eabi> options.


=item B<-mcall-aixdesc>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the AIX
operating system.


=item B<-mcall-linux>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
Linux-based GNU system.


=item B<-mcall-gnu>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
Hurd-based GNU system.


=item B<-mcall-freebsd>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
FreeBSD operating system.


=item B<-mcall-netbsd>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
NetBSD operating system.


=item B<-mcall-openbsd>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
OpenBSD operating system.


=item B<-maix-struct-return>

Return all structures in memory (as specified by the AIX ABI).


=item B<-msvr4-struct-return>

Return structures smaller than 8 bytes in registers (as specified by the
SVR4 ABI).


=item B<-mabi=>I<abi-type>

Extend the current ABI with a particular extension, or remove such extension.
Valid values are I<altivec>, I<no-altivec>, I<spe>,
I<no-spe>, I<ibmlongdouble>, I<ieeelongdouble>.


=item B<-mabi=spe>

Extend the current ABI with SPE ABI extensions.  This does not change
the default ABI, instead it adds the SPE ABI extensions to the current
ABI.


=item B<-mabi=no-spe>

Disable Booke SPE ABI extensions for the current ABI.


=item B<-mabi=ibmlongdouble>

Change the current ABI to use IBM extended precision long double.
This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.


=item B<-mabi=ieeelongdouble>

Change the current ABI to use IEEE extended precision long double.
This is a PowerPC 32-bit Linux ABI option.


=item B<-mprototype>


=item B<-mno-prototype>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all calls to
variable argument functions are properly prototyped.  Otherwise, the
compiler must insert an instruction before every non prototyped call to
set or clear bit 6 of the condition code register (I<CR>) to
indicate whether floating point values were passed in the floating point
registers in case the function takes a variable arguments.  With
B<-mprototype>, only calls to prototyped variable argument functions
will set or clear the bit.


=item B<-msim>

On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
F<sim-crt0.o> and that the standard C libraries are F<libsim.a> and
F<libc.a>.  This is the default for B<powerpc-*-eabisim>
configurations.


=item B<-mmvme>

On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
F<crt0.o> and the standard C libraries are F<libmvme.a> and
F<libc.a>.


=item B<-mads>

On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
F<crt0.o> and the standard C libraries are F<libads.a> and
F<libc.a>.


=item B<-myellowknife>

On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
F<crt0.o> and the standard C libraries are F<libyk.a> and
F<libc.a>.


=item B<-mvxworks>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, specify that you are
compiling for a VxWorks system.


=item B<-memb>

On embedded PowerPC systems, set the I<PPC_EMB> bit in the ELF flags
header to indicate that B<eabi> extended relocations are used.


=item B<-meabi>


=item B<-mno-eabi>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to the
Embedded Applications Binary Interface (eabi) which is a set of
modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting B<-meabi>
means that the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function
C<__eabi> is called to from C<main> to set up the eabi
environment, and the B<-msdata> option can use both C<r2> and
C<r13> to point to two separate small data areas.  Selecting
B<-mno-eabi> means that the stack is aligned to a 16 byte boundary,
do not call an initialization function from C<main>, and the
B<-msdata> option will only use C<r13> to point to a single
small data area.  The B<-meabi> option is on by default if you
configured GCC using one of the B<powerpc*-*-eabi*> options.


=item B<-msdata=eabi>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized
C<const> global and static data in the B<.sdata2> section, which
is pointed to by register C<r2>.  Put small initialized
non-C<const> global and static data in the B<.sdata> section,
which is pointed to by register C<r13>.  Put small uninitialized
global and static data in the B<.sbss> section, which is adjacent to
the B<.sdata> section.  The B<-msdata=eabi> option is
incompatible with the B<-mrelocatable> option.  The
B<-msdata=eabi> option also sets the B<-memb> option.


=item B<-msdata=sysv>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and static
data in the B<.sdata> section, which is pointed to by register
C<r13>.  Put small uninitialized global and static data in the
B<.sbss> section, which is adjacent to the B<.sdata> section.
The B<-msdata=sysv> option is incompatible with the
B<-mrelocatable> option.


=item B<-msdata=default>


=item B<-msdata>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if B<-meabi> is used,
compile code the same as B<-msdata=eabi>, otherwise compile code the
same as B<-msdata=sysv>.


=item B<-msdata=data>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global
data in the B<.sdata> section.  Put small uninitialized global
data in the B<.sbss> section.  Do not use register C<r13>
to address small data however.  This is the default behavior unless
other B<-msdata> options are used.


=item B<-msdata=none>


=item B<-mno-sdata>

On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and static data
in the B<.data> section, and all uninitialized data in the
B<.bss> section.


=item B<-mblock-move-inline-limit=>I<num>

Inline all block moves (such as calls to C<memcpy> or structure
copies) less than or equal to I<num> bytes.  The minimum value for
I<num> is 32 bytes on 32-bit targets and 64 bytes on 64-bit
targets.  The default value is target-specific.


=item B<-G> I<num>

On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than or
equal to I<num> bytes into the small data or bss sections instead of
the normal data or bss section.  By default, I<num> is 8.  The
B<-G> I<num> switch is also passed to the linker.
All modules should be compiled with the same B<-G> I<num> value.


=item B<-mregnames>


=item B<-mno-regnames>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit register
names in the assembly language output using symbolic forms.


=item B<-mlongcall>


=item B<-mno-longcall>

By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
further than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call will be generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the C<shortcall> function attribute, or by C<#pragma
longcall(0)>.

Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the AIX linker can do this,
as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.

On Darwin/PPC systems, C<#pragma longcall> will generate "jbsr
callee, L42", plus a "branch island" (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the "branch island".  The
Darwin/PPC linker will prefer the first address and generate a "bl
callee" if the PPC "bl" instruction will reach the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker will generate "bl L42" to call the "branch
island".  The "branch island" is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.

On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.

In the future, we may cause GCC to ignore all longcall specifications
when the linker is known to generate glue.


=item B<-mtls-markers>


=item B<-mno-tls-markers>

Mark (do not mark) calls to C<__tls_get_addr> with a relocation
specifying the function argument.  The relocation allows ld to
reliably associate function call with argument setup instructions for
TLS optimization, which in turn allows gcc to better schedule the
sequence.


=item B<-pthread>

Adds support for multithreading with the I<pthreads> library.
This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.


=item B<-mrecip>


=item B<-mno-recip>

This option will enable GCC to use the reciprocal estimate and
reciprocal square root estimate instructions with additional
Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision instead of doing a divide or
square root and divide for floating point arguments.  You should use
the B<-ffast-math> option when using B<-mrecip> (or at
least B<-funsafe-math-optimizations>,
B<-finite-math-only>, B<-freciprocal-math> and
B<-fno-trapping-math>).  Note that while the throughput of the
sequence is generally higher than the throughput of the non-reciprocal
instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased by up to 2
ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994) for reciprocal square
roots.


=item B<-mrecip=>I<opt>

This option allows to control which reciprocal estimate instructions
may be used.  I<opt> is a comma separated list of options, that may
be preceded by a C<!> to invert the option:
C<all>: enable all estimate instructions,
C<default>: enable the default instructions, equivalent to B<-mrecip>,
C<none>: disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to B<-mno-recip>;
C<div>: enable the reciprocal approximation instructions for both single and double precision;
C<divf>: enable the single precision reciprocal approximation instructions;
C<divd>: enable the double precision reciprocal approximation instructions;
C<rsqrt>: enable the reciprocal square root approximation instructions for both single and double precision;
C<rsqrtf>: enable the single precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions;
C<rsqrtd>: enable the double precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions;

So for example, B<-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd> would enable the
all of the reciprocal estimate instructions, except for the
C<FRSQRTE>, C<XSRSQRTEDP>, and C<XVRSQRTEDP> instructions
which handle the double precision reciprocal square root calculations.


=item B<-mrecip-precision>


=item B<-mno-recip-precision>

Assume (do not assume) that the reciprocal estimate instructions
provide higher precision estimates than is mandated by the powerpc
ABI.  Selecting B<-mcpu=power6> or B<-mcpu=power7>
automatically selects B<-mrecip-precision>.  The double
precision square root estimate instructions are not generated by
default on low precision machines, since they do not provide an
estimate that converges after three steps.


=item B<-mveclibabi=>I<type>

Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an
external library.  The only type supported at present is C<mass>,
which specifies to use IBM's Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem
(MASS) libraries for vectorizing intrinsics using external libraries.
GCC will currently emit calls to C<acosd2>, C<acosf4>,
C<acoshd2>, C<acoshf4>, C<asind2>, C<asinf4>,
C<asinhd2>, C<asinhf4>, C<atan2d2>, C<atan2f4>,
C<atand2>, C<atanf4>, C<atanhd2>, C<atanhf4>,
C<cbrtd2>, C<cbrtf4>, C<cosd2>, C<cosf4>,
C<coshd2>, C<coshf4>, C<erfcd2>, C<erfcf4>,
C<erfd2>, C<erff4>, C<exp2d2>, C<exp2f4>,
C<expd2>, C<expf4>, C<expm1d2>, C<expm1f4>,
C<hypotd2>, C<hypotf4>, C<lgammad2>, C<lgammaf4>,
C<log10d2>, C<log10f4>, C<log1pd2>, C<log1pf4>,
C<log2d2>, C<log2f4>, C<logd2>, C<logf4>,
C<powd2>, C<powf4>, C<sind2>, C<sinf4>, C<sinhd2>,
C<sinhf4>, C<sqrtd2>, C<sqrtf4>, C<tand2>,
C<tanf4>, C<tanhd2>, and C<tanhf4> when generating code
for power7.  Both B<-ftree-vectorize> and
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> have to be enabled.  The MASS
libraries will have to be specified at link time.


=item B<-mfriz>


=item B<-mno-friz>

Generate (do not generate) the C<friz> instruction when the
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> option is used to optimize
rounding a floating point value to 64-bit integer and back to floating
point.  The C<friz> instruction does not return the same value if
the floating point number is too large to fit in an integer.

=head3 RX Options


These command line options are defined for RX targets:


=over 4


=item B<-m64bit-doubles>


=item B<-m32bit-doubles>

Make the C<double> data type be 64-bits (B<-m64bit-doubles>)
or 32-bits (B<-m32bit-doubles>) in size.  The default is
B<-m32bit-doubles>.  I<Note> RX floating point hardware only
works on 32-bit values, which is why the default is
B<-m32bit-doubles>.


=item B<-fpu>


=item B<-nofpu>

Enables (B<-fpu>) or disables (B<-nofpu>) the use of RX
floating point hardware.  The default is enabled for the I<RX600>
series and disabled for the I<RX200> series.

Floating point instructions will only be generated for 32-bit floating
point values however, so if the B<-m64bit-doubles> option is in
use then the FPU hardware will not be used for doubles.

I<Note> If the B<-fpu> option is enabled then
B<-funsafe-math-optimizations> is also enabled automatically.
This is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves unsafe.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<name>

Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three types are
supported, the generic I<RX600> and I<RX200> series hardware and
the specific I<RX610> CPU.  The default is I<RX600>.

The only difference between I<RX600> and I<RX610> is that the
I<RX610> does not support the C<MVTIPL> instruction.

The I<RX200> series does not have a hardware floating point unit
and so B<-nofpu> is enabled by default when this type is
selected.


=item B<-mbig-endian-data>


=item B<-mlittle-endian-data>

Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default is
B<-mlittle-endian-data>, i.e. to store data in the little endian
format.


=item B<-msmall-data-limit=>I<N>

Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the RX's
registers (C<r13>) is reserved for use pointing to this area, so
it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This could result
in slower and/or larger code if variables which once could have been
held in C<r13> are now pushed onto the stack.

Note, common variables (variables which have not been initialised) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.

The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(B<-O2> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving register C<r13>.  It is up to the programmer to
experiment and discover whether this feature is of benefit to their
program.


=item B<-msim>


=item B<-mno-sim>

Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss board
specific runtime.


=item B<-mas100-syntax>


=item B<-mno-as100-syntax>

When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with
Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the GAS
assembler but it has some restrictions so generating it is not the
default option.


=item B<-mmax-constant-size=>I<N>

Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.

The value I<N> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)
or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.


=item B<-mrelax>

Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the
linker will attempt to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter
versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.


=item B<-mint-register=>I<N>

Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value I<N> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register C<r13> will be reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves C<r13> and
C<r12>.  A value of 3 reserves C<r13>, C<r12> and
C<r11>, and a value of 4 reserves C<r13> through C<r10>.
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.


=item B<-msave-acc-in-interrupts>

Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this
makes the interrupt handlers faster.


=back


I<Note:> The generic GCC command line B<-ffixed->I<reg>
has special significance to the RX port when used with the
C<interrupt> function attribute.  This attribute indicates a
function intended to process fast interrupts.  GCC will will ensure
that it only uses the registers C<r10>, C<r11>, C<r12>
and/or C<r13> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
B<-ffixed->I<reg> or B<-mint-register> command line
options.


=head3 S/390 and zSeries Options


These are the B<-m> options defined for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.


=over 4


=item B<-mhard-float>


=item B<-msoft-float>

Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and registers
for floating-point operations.  When B<-msoft-float> is specified,
functions in F<libgcc.a> will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  When B<-mhard-float> is specified, the compiler
generates IEEE floating-point instructions.  This is the default.


=item B<-mhard-dfp>


=item B<-mno-hard-dfp>

Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point instructions for
decimal-floating-point operations.  When B<-mno-hard-dfp> is
specified, functions in F<libgcc.a> will be used to perform
decimal-floating-point operations.  When B<-mhard-dfp> is
specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point hardware
instructions.  This is the default for B<-march=z9-ec> or higher.


=item B<-mlong-double-64>


=item B<-mlong-double-128>

These switches control the size of C<long double> type. A size
of 64bit makes the C<long double> type equivalent to the C<double>
type. This is the default.


=item B<-mbackchain>


=item B<-mno-backchain>

Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer
into the callee's stack frame.
A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
DWARF-2 call frame information.
When B<-mno-packed-stack> is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored
at the bottom of the stack frame; when B<-mpacked-stack> is in effect,
the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.

In general, code compiled with B<-mbackchain> is call-compatible with
code compiled with B<-mmo-backchain>; however, use of the backchain
for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is built with
B<-mbackchain>.  Note that the combination of B<-mbackchain>,
B<-mpacked-stack> and B<-mhard-float> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use B<-msoft-float>.

The default is to not maintain the backchain.


=item B<-mpacked-stack>


=item B<-mno-packed-stack>

Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When B<-mno-packed-stack> is
specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save
area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When B<-mpacked-stack> is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when B<-mbackchain> is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.

As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with
B<-mpacked-stack> is call-compatible with code generated with
B<-mno-packed-stack>.  Note that some non-FSF releases of GCC 2.95 for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with B<-mpacked-stack>.  Also, note that the
combination of B<-mbackchain>,
B<-mpacked-stack> and B<-mhard-float> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use B<-msoft-float>.

The default is to not use the packed stack layout.


=item B<-msmall-exec>


=item B<-mno-small-exec>

Generate (or do not generate) code using the C<bras> instruction
to do subroutine calls.
This only works reliably if the total executable size does not
exceed 64k.  The default is to use the C<basr> instruction instead,
which does not have this limitation.


=item B<-m64>


=item B<-m31>

When B<-m31> is specified, generate code compliant to the
GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI.  When B<-m64> is specified, generate
code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI.  This allows GCC in
particular to generate 64-bit instructions.  For the B<s390>
targets, the default is B<-m31>, while the B<s390x>
targets default to B<-m64>.


=item B<-mzarch>


=item B<-mesa>

When B<-mzarch> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on z/Architecture.
When B<-mesa> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on ESA/390.  Note that B<-mesa> is
not possible with B<-m64>.
When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI,
the default is B<-mesa>.  When generating code compliant
to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is B<-mzarch>.


=item B<-mmvcle>


=item B<-mno-mvcle>

Generate (or do not generate) code using the C<mvcle> instruction
to perform block moves.  When B<-mno-mvcle> is specified,
use a C<mvc> loop instead.  This is the default unless optimizing for
size.


=item B<-mdebug>


=item B<-mno-debug>

Print (or do not print) additional debug information when compiling.
The default is to not print debug information.


=item B<-march=>I<cpu-type>

Generate code that will run on I<cpu-type>, which is the name of a system
representing a certain processor type.  Possible values for
I<cpu-type> are B<g5>, B<g6>, B<z900>, B<z990>,
B<z9-109>, B<z9-ec> and B<z10>.
When generating code using the instructions available on z/Architecture,
the default is B<-march=z900>.  Otherwise, the default is
B<-march=g5>.


=item B<-mtune=>I<cpu-type>

Tune to I<cpu-type> everything applicable about the generated code,
except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.
The list of I<cpu-type> values is the same as for B<-march>.
The default is the value used for B<-march>.


=item B<-mtpf-trace>


=item B<-mno-tpf-trace>

Generate code that adds (does not add) in TPF OS specific branches to trace
routines in the operating system.  This option is off by default, even
when compiling for the TPF OS.


=item B<-mfused-madd>


=item B<-mno-fused-madd>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default if
hardware floating point is used.


=item B<-mwarn-framesize=>I<framesize>

Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame size.  Because
this is a compile time check it doesn't need to be a real problem when the program
runs.  It is intended to identify functions which most probably cause
a stack overflow.  It is useful to be used in an environment with limited stack
size e.g. the linux kernel.


=item B<-mwarn-dynamicstack>

Emit a warning if the function calls alloca or uses dynamically
sized arrays.  This is generally a bad idea with a limited stack size.


=item B<-mstack-guard=>I<stack-guard>


=item B<-mstack-size=>I<stack-size>

If these options are provided the s390 back end emits additional instructions in
the function prologue which trigger a trap if the stack size is I<stack-guard>
bytes above the I<stack-size> (remember that the stack on s390 grows downward).
If the I<stack-guard> option is omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than
the frame size of the compiled function is chosen.
These options are intended to be used to help debugging stack overflow problems.
The additionally emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be
used in production like systems without greater performance degradation.  The given
values have to be exact powers of 2 and I<stack-size> has to be greater than
I<stack-guard> without exceeding 64k.
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by I<stack-size>.
The I<stack-guard> option can only be used in conjunction with I<stack-size>.

=back



=head3 Score Options


These options are defined for Score implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-meb>

Compile code for big endian mode.  This is the default.


=item B<-mel>

Compile code for little endian mode.


=item B<-mnhwloop>

Disable generate bcnz instruction.


=item B<-muls>

Enable generate unaligned load and store instruction.


=item B<-mmac>

Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled by default.


=item B<-mscore5>

Specify the SCORE5 as the target architecture.


=item B<-mscore5u>

Specify the SCORE5U of the target architecture.


=item B<-mscore7>

Specify the SCORE7 as the target architecture. This is the default.


=item B<-mscore7d>

Specify the SCORE7D as the target architecture.

=back



=head3 SH Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the SH implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-m1>

Generate code for the SH1.


=item B<-m2>

Generate code for the SH2.


=item B<-m2e>

Generate code for the SH2e.


=item B<-m2a-nofpu>

Generate code for the SH2a without FPU, or for a SH2a-FPU in such a way
that the floating-point unit is not used.


=item B<-m2a-single-only>

Generate code for the SH2a-FPU, in such a way that no double-precision
floating point operations are used.


=item B<-m2a-single>

Generate code for the SH2a-FPU assuming the floating-point unit is in
single-precision mode by default.


=item B<-m2a>

Generate code for the SH2a-FPU assuming the floating-point unit is in
double-precision mode by default.


=item B<-m3>

Generate code for the SH3.


=item B<-m3e>

Generate code for the SH3e.


=item B<-m4-nofpu>

Generate code for the SH4 without a floating-point unit.


=item B<-m4-single-only>

Generate code for the SH4 with a floating-point unit that only
supports single-precision arithmetic.


=item B<-m4-single>

Generate code for the SH4 assuming the floating-point unit is in
single-precision mode by default.


=item B<-m4>

Generate code for the SH4.


=item B<-m4a-nofpu>

Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a SH4a in such a way that the
floating-point unit is not used.


=item B<-m4a-single-only>

Generate code for the SH4a, in such a way that no double-precision
floating point operations are used.


=item B<-m4a-single>

Generate code for the SH4a assuming the floating-point unit is in
single-precision mode by default.


=item B<-m4a>

Generate code for the SH4a.


=item B<-m4al>

Same as B<-m4a-nofpu>, except that it implicitly passes
B<-dsp> to the assembler.  GCC doesn't generate any DSP
instructions at the moment.


=item B<-mb>

Compile code for the processor in big endian mode.


=item B<-ml>

Compile code for the processor in little endian mode.


=item B<-mdalign>

Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries.  Note that this changes the calling
conventions, and thus some functions from the standard C library will
not work unless you recompile it first with B<-mdalign>.


=item B<-mrelax>

Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses the
linker option B<-relax>.


=item B<-mbigtable>

Use 32-bit offsets in C<switch> tables.  The default is to use
16-bit offsets.


=item B<-mbitops>

Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on SH2A.


=item B<-mfmovd>

Enable the use of the instruction C<fmovd>.  Check B<-mdalign> for
alignment constraints.


=item B<-mhitachi>

Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.


=item B<-mrenesas>

Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.


=item B<-mno-renesas>

Comply with the calling conventions defined for GCC before the Renesas
conventions were available.  This option is the default for all
targets of the SH toolchain except for B<sh-symbianelf>.


=item B<-mnomacsave>

Mark the C<MAC> register as call-clobbered, even if
B<-mhitachi> is given.


=item B<-mieee>

Increase IEEE-compliance of floating-point code.
At the moment, this is equivalent to B<-fno-finite-math-only>.
When generating 16 bit SH opcodes, getting IEEE-conforming results for
comparisons of NANs / infinities incurs extra overhead in every
floating point comparison, therefore the default is set to
B<-ffinite-math-only>.


=item B<-minline-ic_invalidate>

Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after setting up
nested function trampolines.
This option has no effect if -musermode is in effect and the selected
code generation option (e.g. -m4) does not allow the use of the icbi
instruction.
If the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the icbi
instruction, and -musermode is not in effect, the inlined code will
manipulate the instruction cache address array directly with an associative
write.  This not only requires privileged mode, but it will also
fail if the cache line had been mapped via the TLB and has become unmapped.


=item B<-misize>

Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.


=item B<-mpadstruct>

This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4 bytes,
which is incompatible with the SH ABI.


=item B<-mspace>

Optimize for space instead of speed.  Implied by B<-Os>.


=item B<-mprefergot>

When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using
the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Table.


=item B<-musermode>

Don't generate privileged mode only code; implies -mno-inline-ic_invalidate
if the inlined code would not work in user mode.
This is the default when the target is C<sh-*-linux*>.


=item B<-multcost=>I<number>

Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.


=item B<-mdiv=>I<strategy>

Set the division strategy to use for SHmedia code.  I<strategy> must be
one of: call, call2, fp, inv, inv:minlat, inv20u, inv20l, inv:call,
inv:call2, inv:fp .
"fp" performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily exploitable ILP to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating point exception.
"inv" uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
cse and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
"inv:minlat" is a variant of "inv" where if no cse / hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
"call" calls a library function that usually implements the inv:minlat
strategy.
This gives high code density for m5-*media-nofpu compilations.
"call2" uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it
assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has already been set up, which
exposes the pointer load to cse / code hoisting optimizations.
"inv:call", "inv:call2" and "inv:fp" all use the "inv" algorithm for initial
code generation, but if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the "call",
"call2", or "fp" strategies, respectively.  Note that the
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to fp operations or a call is not possible in that case.
"inv20u" and "inv20l" are variants of the "inv:minlat" strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation was nor separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable),
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  inv20u assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and inv20l assumes it to be likely.


=item B<-maccumulate-outgoing-args>

Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue rather 
than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also
needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.


=item B<-mdivsi3_libfunc=>I<name>

Set the name of the library function used for 32 bit signed division to
I<name>.  This only affect the name used in the call and inv:call
division strategies, and the compiler will still expect the same
sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option was not present.


=item B<-mfixed-range=>I<register-range>

Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.


=item B<-madjust-unroll>

Throttle unrolling to avoid thrashing target registers.
This option only has an effect if the gcc code base supports the
TARGET_ADJUST_UNROLL_MAX target hook.


=item B<-mindexed-addressing>

Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or OS implement 32 bit wrap-around
semantics for the indexed addressing mode.  The architecture allows the
implementation of processors with 64 bit MMU, which the OS could use to
get 32 bit addressing, but since no current hardware implementation supports
this or any other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in
the 32 bit ABI, the default is -mno-indexed-addressing.


=item B<-mgettrcost=>I<number>

Set the cost assumed for the gettr instruction to I<number>.
The default is 2 if B<-mpt-fixed> is in effect, 100 otherwise.


=item B<-mpt-fixed>

Assume pt* instructions won't trap.  This will generally generate better
scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.  The current architecture
definition says that ptabs and ptrel trap when the target anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule ptabs /
ptrel before a branch, or hoist it out of a loop.  For example,
__do_global_ctors, a part of libgcc that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by -1.  With the
-mpt-fixed option, the ptabs will be done before testing against -1.
That means that all the constructors will be run a bit quicker, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because ptabs
loads -1 into a target register.  Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is -mno-pt-fixed.  Unless the user specifies a specific cost with
B<-mgettrcost>, -mno-pt-fixed also implies B<-mgettrcost=100>;
this deters register allocation using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.


=item B<-minvalid-symbols>

Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols generated by
the compiler will always be valid to load with movi/shori/ptabs or
movi/shori/ptrel, but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that will cause ptabs / ptrel to trap.
This option is only meaningful when B<-mno-pt-fixed> is in effect.
It will then prevent cross-basic-block cse, hoisting and most scheduling
of symbol loads.  The default is B<-mno-invalid-symbols>.

=back



=head3 Solaris 2 Options


These B<-m> options are supported on Solaris 2:


=over 4


=item B<-mimpure-text>

B<-mimpure-text>, used in addition to B<-shared>, tells
the compiler to not pass B<-z text> to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.

B<-mimpure-text> suppresses the "relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections" linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations will trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using B<-mimpure-text>, you should compile all source code with
B<-fpic> or B<-fPIC>.


=back


These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:


=over 4


=item B<-threads>

Add support for multithreading using the Solaris threads library.  This
option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.  This option does
not affect the thread safety of object code produced by the compiler or
that of libraries supplied with it.


=item B<-pthreads>

Add support for multithreading using the POSIX threads library.  This
option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.  This option does
not affect the thread safety of object code produced  by the compiler or
that of libraries supplied with it.


=item B<-pthread>

This is a synonym for B<-pthreads>.

=back



=head3 SPARC Options


These B<-m> options are supported on the SPARC:


=over 4


=item B<-mno-app-regs>


=item B<-mapp-regs>

Specify B<-mapp-regs> to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.  This
is the default.

To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify B<-mno-app-regs>.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.


=item B<-mfpu>


=item B<-mhard-float>

Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default.


=item B<-mno-fpu>


=item B<-msoft-float>

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
B<Warning:> the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets B<sparc-*-aout> and
B<sparclite-*-*> do provide software floating point support.

B<-msoft-float> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile I<all> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile F<libgcc.a>, the
library that comes with GCC, with B<-msoft-float> in order for
this to work.


=item B<-mhard-quad-float>

Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
instructions.


=item B<-msoft-quad-float>

Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the
B<-msoft-quad-float> option is the default.


=item B<-mno-unaligned-doubles>


=item B<-munaligned-doubles>

Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.

With B<-munaligned-doubles>, GCC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating point code.


=item B<-mno-faster-structs>


=item B<-mfaster-structs>

With B<-mfaster-structs>, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8 byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
C<ldd> and C<std> instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many C<ld> and C<st> pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC
ABI.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code will not be directly in line with
the rules of the ABI.


=item B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type>

Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters
for machine type I<cpu_type>.  Supported values for I<cpu_type> are
B<v7>, B<cypress>, B<v8>, B<supersparc>, B<hypersparc>,
B<leon>, B<sparclite>, B<f930>, B<f934>, B<sparclite86x>,
B<sparclet>, B<tsc701>, B<v9>, B<ultrasparc>,
B<ultrasparc3>, B<niagara> and B<niagara2>.

Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that select
an architecture and not an implementation.  These are B<v7>, B<v8>,
B<sparclite>, B<sparclet>, B<v9>.

Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported
implementations.

	
	    v7:             cypress
	    v8:             supersparc, hypersparc, leon
	    sparclite:      f930, f934, sparclite86x
	    sparclet:       tsc701
	    v9:             ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2


By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code for the V7
variant of the SPARC architecture.  With B<-mcpu=cypress>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is also appropriate for the older
SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

With B<-mcpu=v8>, GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the SPARC
architecture.  The only difference from V7 code is that the compiler emits
the integer multiply and integer divide instructions which exist in SPARC-V8
but not in SPARC-V7.  With B<-mcpu=supersparc>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and
2000 series.

With B<-mcpu=sparclite>, GCC generates code for the SPARClite variant of
the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply, integer divide step
and scan (C<ffs>) instructions which exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7.
With B<-mcpu=f930>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the original SPARClite, with no FPU.  With
B<-mcpu=f934>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu
MB86934 chip, which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.

With B<-mcpu=sparclet>, GCC generates code for the SPARClet variant of
the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply, multiply/accumulate,
integer divide step and scan (C<ffs>) instructions which exist in SPARClet
but not in SPARC-V7.  With B<-mcpu=tsc701>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.

With B<-mcpu=v9>, GCC generates code for the V9 variant of the SPARC
architecture.  This adds 64-bit integer and floating-point move instructions,
3 additional floating-point condition code registers and conditional move
instructions.  With B<-mcpu=ultrasparc>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips.  With
B<-mcpu=ultrasparc3>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips.  With
B<-mcpu=niagara>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips.  With B<-mcpu=niagara2>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2 chips.


=item B<-mtune=>I<cpu_type>

Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
I<cpu_type>, but do not set the instruction set or register set that the
option B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type> would.

The same values for B<-mcpu=>I<cpu_type> can be used for
B<-mtune=>I<cpu_type>, but the only useful values are those
that select a particular CPU implementation.  Those are B<cypress>,
B<supersparc>, B<hypersparc>, B<leon>, B<f930>, B<f934>,
B<sparclite86x>, B<tsc701>, B<ultrasparc>, B<ultrasparc3>,
B<niagara>, and B<niagara2>.


=item B<-mv8plus>


=item B<-mno-v8plus>

With B<-mv8plus>, GCC generates code for the SPARC-V8+ ABI.  The
difference from the V8 ABI is that the global and out registers are
considered 64-bit wide.  This is enabled by default on Solaris in 32-bit
mode for all SPARC-V9 processors.


=item B<-mvis>


=item B<-mno-vis>

With B<-mvis>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the UltraSPARC
Visual Instruction Set extensions.  The default is B<-mno-vis>.


=item B<-mfix-at697f>

Enable the documented workaround for the single erratum of the Atmel AT697F
processor (which corresponds to erratum #13 of the AT697E processor).

=back


These B<-m> options are supported in addition to the above
on SPARC-V9 processors in 64-bit environments:


=over 4


=item B<-mlittle-endian>

Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  It is only
available for a few configurations and most notably not on Solaris and Linux.


=item B<-m32>


=item B<-m64>

Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.
The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.
The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
to 64 bits.


=item B<-mcmodel=medlow>

Generate code for the Medium/Low code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
must be linked in the low 32 bits of memory.  Programs can be statically
or dynamically linked.


=item B<-mcmodel=medmid>

Generate code for the Medium/Middle code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
must be linked in the low 44 bits of memory, the text and data segments must
be less than 2GB in size and the data segment must be located within 2GB of
the text segment.


=item B<-mcmodel=medany>

Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
may be linked anywhere in memory, the text and data segments must be less
than 2GB in size and the data segment must be located within 2GB of the
text segment.


=item B<-mcmodel=embmedany>

Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems:
64-bit addresses, the text and data segments must be less than 2GB in
size, both starting anywhere in memory (determined at link time).  The
global register %g4 points to the base of the data segment.  Programs
are statically linked and PIC is not supported.


=item B<-mstack-bias>


=item B<-mno-stack-bias>

With B<-mstack-bias>, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and
frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back
when making stack frame references.  This is the default in 64-bit mode.
Otherwise, assume no such offset is present.

=back



=head3 SPU Options


These B<-m> options are supported on the SPU:


=over 4


=item B<-mwarn-reloc>


=item B<-merror-reloc>


The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations.  By default, GCC
will give an error when it generates code that requires a dynamic
relocation.  B<-mno-error-reloc> disables the error,
B<-mwarn-reloc> will generate a warning instead.


=item B<-msafe-dma>


=item B<-munsafe-dma>


Instructions which initiate or test completion of DMA must not be
reordered with respect to loads and stores of the memory which is being
accessed.  Users typically address this problem using the volatile
keyword, but that can lead to inefficient code in places where the
memory is known to not change.  Rather than mark the memory as volatile
we treat the DMA instructions as potentially effecting all memory.  With
B<-munsafe-dma> users must use the volatile keyword to protect
memory accesses.


=item B<-mbranch-hints>


By default, GCC will generate a branch hint instruction to avoid
pipeline stalls for always taken or probably taken branches.  A hint
will not be generated closer than 8 instructions away from its branch.
There is little reason to disable them, except for debugging purposes,
or to make an object a little bit smaller.


=item B<-msmall-mem>


=item B<-mlarge-mem>


By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are never larger
than 18 bits.  With B<-mlarge-mem> code is generated that assumes
a full 32 bit address.


=item B<-mstdmain>


By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the SPU-style
main function interface (which has an unconventional parameter list).
With B<-mstdmain>, GCC will link your program against startup
code that assumes a C99-style interface to C<main>, including a
local copy of C<argv> strings.


=item B<-mfixed-range=>I<register-range>

Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.


=item B<-mea32>


=item B<-mea64>

Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space accessed
via the C<__ea> named address space qualifier are either 32 or 64
bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this is an ABI changing option,
all object code in an executable must be compiled with the same setting.


=item B<-maddress-space-conversion>


=item B<-mno-address-space-conversion>

Allow/disallow treating the C<__ea> address space as superset
of the generic address space.  This enables explicit type casts
between C<__ea> and generic pointer as well as implicit
conversions of generic pointers to C<__ea> pointers.  The
default is to allow address space pointer conversions.


=item B<-mcache-size=>I<cache-size>

This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects a software-managed cache for accessing variables
in the C<__ea> address space with a particular cache size.  Possible
options for I<cache-size> are B<8>, B<16>, B<32>, B<64>
and B<128>.  The default cache size is 64KB.


=item B<-matomic-updates>


=item B<-mno-atomic-updates>

This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects whether atomic updates to the software-managed
cache of PPU-side variables are used.  If you use atomic updates, changes
to a PPU variable from SPU code using the C<__ea> named address space
qualifier will not interfere with changes to other PPU variables residing
in the same cache line from PPU code.  If you do not use atomic updates,
such interference may occur; however, writing back cache lines will be
more efficient.  The default behavior is to use atomic updates.


=item B<-mdual-nops>


=item B<-mdual-nops=>I<n>

By default, GCC will insert nops to increase dual issue when it expects
it to increase performance.  I<n> can be a value from 0 to 10.  A
smaller I<n> will insert fewer nops.  10 is the default, 0 is the
same as B<-mno-dual-nops>.  Disabled with B<-Os>.


=item B<-mhint-max-nops=>I<n>

Maximum number of nops to insert for a branch hint.  A branch hint must
be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it is effecting.  GCC
will insert up to I<n> nops to enforce this, otherwise it will not
generate the branch hint.


=item B<-mhint-max-distance=>I<n>

The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint to be within
256 instructions of the branch it is effecting.  By default, GCC makes
sure it is within 125.


=item B<-msafe-hints>

Work around a hardware bug which causes the SPU to stall indefinitely.
By default, GCC will insert the C<hbrp> instruction to make sure
this stall won't happen.


=back



=head3 Options for System V


These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
compatibility with other compilers on those systems:


=over 4


=item B<-G>

Create a shared object.
It is recommended that B<-symbolic> or B<-shared> be used instead.


=item B<-Qy>

Identify the versions of each tool used by the compiler, in a
C<.ident> assembler directive in the output.


=item B<-Qn>

Refrain from adding C<.ident> directives to the output file (this is
the default).


=item B<-YP,>I<dirs>

Search the directories I<dirs>, and no others, for libraries
specified with B<-l>.


=item B<-Ym,>I<dir>

Look in the directory I<dir> to find the M4 preprocessor.
The assembler uses this option.

=back



=head3 V850 Options


These B<-m> options are defined for V850 implementations:


=over 4


=item B<-mlong-calls>


=item B<-mno-long-calls>

Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to be
far away, the compiler will always load the functions address up into a
register, and call indirect through the pointer.


=item B<-mno-ep>


=item B<-mep>

Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index
pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the C<ep> register, and
use the shorter C<sld> and C<sst> instructions.  The B<-mep>
option is on by default if you optimize.


=item B<-mno-prolog-function>


=item B<-mprolog-function>

Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore registers
at the prologue and epilogue of a function.  The external functions
are slower, but use less code space if more than one function saves
the same number of registers.  The B<-mprolog-function> option
is on by default if you optimize.


=item B<-mspace>

Try to make the code as small as possible.  At present, this just turns
on the B<-mep> and B<-mprolog-function> options.


=item B<-mtda=>I<n>

Put static or global variables whose size is I<n> bytes or less into
the tiny data area that register C<ep> points to.  The tiny data
area can hold up to 256 bytes in total (128 bytes for byte references).


=item B<-msda=>I<n>

Put static or global variables whose size is I<n> bytes or less into
the small data area that register C<gp> points to.  The small data
area can hold up to 64 kilobytes.


=item B<-mzda=>I<n>

Put static or global variables whose size is I<n> bytes or less into
the first 32 kilobytes of memory.


=item B<-mv850>

Specify that the target processor is the V850.


=item B<-mbig-switch>

Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.


=item B<-mapp-regs>

This option will cause r2 and r5 to be used in the code generated by
the compiler.  This setting is the default.


=item B<-mno-app-regs>

This option will cause r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed registers.


=item B<-mv850e2v3>

Specify that the target processor is the V850E2V3.  The preprocessor
constants B<__v850e2v3__> will be defined if
this option is used.


=item B<-mv850e2>

Specify that the target processor is the V850E2.  The preprocessor
constants B<__v850e2__> will be defined if


=item B<-mv850e1>

Specify that the target processor is the V850E1.  The preprocessor
constants B<__v850e1__> and B<__v850e__> will be defined if


=item B<-mv850es>

Specify that the target processor is the V850ES.  This is an alias for
the B<-mv850e1> option.


=item B<-mv850e>

Specify that the target processor is the V850E.  The preprocessor
constant B<__v850e__> will be defined if this option is used.

If neither B<-mv850> nor B<-mv850e> nor B<-mv850e1>
nor B<-mv850e2> nor B<-mv850e2v3>
are defined then a default target processor will be chosen and the
relevant B<__v850*__> preprocessor constant will be defined.

The preprocessor constants B<__v850> and B<__v851__> are always
defined, regardless of which processor variant is the target.


=item B<-mdisable-callt>

This option will suppress generation of the CALLT instruction for the
v850e, v850e1, v850e2 and v850e2v3 flavors of the v850 architecture.  The default is
B<-mno-disable-callt> which allows the CALLT instruction to be used.


=back



=head3 VAX Options


These B<-m> options are defined for the VAX:


=over 4


=item B<-munix>

Do not output certain jump instructions (C<aobleq> and so on)
that the Unix assembler for the VAX cannot handle across long
ranges.


=item B<-mgnu>

Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that you
will assemble with the GNU assembler.


=item B<-mg>

Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead of d-format.

=back



=head3 VxWorks Options


The options in this section are defined for all VxWorks targets.
Options specific to the target hardware are listed with the other
options for that target.


=over 4


=item B<-mrtp>

GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time processes
(RTPs).  This option switches from the former to the latter.  It also
defines the preprocessor macro C<__RTP__>.


=item B<-non-static>

Link an RTP executable against shared libraries rather than static
libraries.  The options B<-static> and B<-shared> can
also be used for RTPs; B<-static>
is the default.


=item B<-Bstatic>


=item B<-Bdynamic>

These options are passed down to the linker.  They are defined for
compatibility with Diab.


=item B<-Xbind-lazy>

Enable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is equivalent to
B<-Wl,-z,now> and is defined for compatibility with Diab.


=item B<-Xbind-now>

Disable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is the default and
is defined for compatibility with Diab.

=back



=head3 x86-64 Options


These are listed under 


=head3 Xstormy16 Options


These options are defined for Xstormy16:


=over 4


=item B<-msim>

Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.

=back



=head3 Xtensa Options


These options are supported for Xtensa targets:


=over 4


=item B<-mconst16>


=item B<-mno-const16>

Enable or disable use of C<CONST16> instructions for loading
constant values.  The C<CONST16> instruction is currently not a
standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, C<CONST16>
instructions are always used in place of the standard C<L32R>
instructions.  The use of C<CONST16> is enabled by default only if
the C<L32R> instruction is not available.


=item B<-mfused-madd>


=item B<-mno-fused-madd>

Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict IEEE 754-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with I<more> bits of
precision than specified by the IEEE standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.


=item B<-mserialize-volatile>


=item B<-mno-serialize-volatile>

When this option is enabled, GCC inserts C<MEMW> instructions before
C<volatile> memory references to guarantee sequential consistency.
The default is B<-mserialize-volatile>.  Use
B<-mno-serialize-volatile> to omit the C<MEMW> instructions.


=item B<-mforce-no-pic>

For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be
position-independent code (PIC), this option disables PIC for compiling
kernel code.


=item B<-mtext-section-literals>


=item B<-mno-text-section-literals>

Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
B<-mno-text-section-literals>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With B<-mtext-section-literals>, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly
files.


=item B<-mtarget-align>


=item B<-mno-target-align>

When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening will be performed.  The
default is B<-mtarget-align>.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like C<LOOP>, which the
assembler will always align, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting no-op instructions.


=item B<-mlongcalls>


=item B<-mno-longcalls>

When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct C<CALL>
instruction into an C<L32R> followed by a C<CALLX> instruction.
The default is B<-mno-longcalls>.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by GCC will still show direct call
instructions---look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler will use an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really will be out of range.

=head3 zSeries Options


These are listed under 


=head2 Options for Code Generation Conventions


These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of B<-ffoo> would be B<-fno-foo>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed---the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing B<no-> or adding
it.


=over 4


=item B<-fbounds-check>

For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.


=item B<-ftrapv>

This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.


=item B<-fwrapv>

This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front-end, as required by the Java language specification.


=item B<-fexceptions>

Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like
C++ which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't
use exception handling.


=item B<-fnon-call-exceptions>

Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows I<trapping>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating
point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as C<SIGALRM>.


=item B<-funwind-tables>

Similar to B<-fexceptions>, except that it will just generate any needed
static data, but will not affect the generated code in any other way.
You will normally not enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.


=item B<-fasynchronous-unwind-tables>

Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).


=item B<-fpcc-struct-return>

Return "short" C<struct> and C<union> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.

Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

B<Warning:> code compiled with the B<-fpcc-struct-return>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
B<-freg-struct-return> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.


=item B<-freg-struct-return>

Return C<struct> and C<union> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
B<-fpcc-struct-return>.

If you specify neither B<-fpcc-struct-return> nor
B<-freg-struct-return>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to B<-fpcc-struct-return>, except on targets where GCC is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

B<Warning:> code compiled with the B<-freg-struct-return>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
B<-fpcc-struct-return> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.


=item B<-fshort-enums>

Allocate to an C<enum> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the C<enum> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.

B<Warning:> the B<-fshort-enums> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.


=item B<-fshort-double>

Use the same size for C<double> as for C<float>.

B<Warning:> the B<-fshort-double> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.


=item B<-fshort-wchar>

Override the underlying type for B<wchar_t> to be B<short
unsigned int> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under WINE.

B<Warning:> the B<-fshort-wchar> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.


=item B<-fno-common>

In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by B<-fcommon>, and is the default
for GCC on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO C, and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The B<-fno-common> option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without C<extern>) in two different compilations,
you will get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with B<-fcommon> instead.
Compiling with B<-fno-common> is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.


=item B<-fno-ident>

Ignore the B<#ident> directive.


=item B<-finhibit-size-directive>

Don't output a C<.size> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling F<crtstuff.c>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.


=item B<-fverbose-asm>

Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

B<-fno-verbose-asm>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.


=item B<-frecord-gcc-switches>

This switch causes the command line that was used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
switch is related to the B<-fverbose-asm> switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.


=item B<-fpic>

Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
B<-fpic> does not work; in that case, recompile with B<-fPIC>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.

When this flag is set, the macros C<__pic__> and C<__PIC__>
are defined to 1.


=item B<-fPIC>

If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
PowerPC and SPARC.

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

When this flag is set, the macros C<__pic__> and C<__PIC__>
are defined to 2.


=item B<-fpie>


=item B<-fPIE>

These options are similar to B<-fpic> and B<-fPIC>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when B<-pie> GCC option will be
used during linking.

B<-fpie> and B<-fPIE> both define the macros
C<__pie__> and C<__PIE__>.  The macros have the value 1
for B<-fpie> and 2 for B<-fPIE>.


=item B<-fno-jump-tables>

Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with B<-fpic> or B<-fPIC> for
building code which forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.


=item B<-ffixed->I<reg>

Treat the register named I<reg> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

I<reg> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the C<REGISTER_NAMES>
macro in the machine description macro file.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.


=item B<-fcall-used->I<reg>

Treat the register named I<reg> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register I<reg>.

It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.


=item B<-fcall-saved->I<reg>

Treat the register named I<reg> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register I<reg> if they use it.

It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.

A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.


=item B<-fpack-struct[=>I<n>B<]>

Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this will be output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.

B<Warning:> the B<-fpack-struct> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.


=item B<-finstrument-functions>

Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
C<__builtin_return_address> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

	
	void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
	                               void *call_site);
	void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
	                               void *call_site);


The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use B<extern inline> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

A function may be given the attribute C<no_instrument_function>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).


=item B<-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=>I<file>B<,>I<file>B<,...>


Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of C<-finstrument-functions>).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of I<file>, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the I<file> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.

For example:

	
	-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys


will exclude any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain C</bits/stl> or C<include/sys>.

If, for some reason, you want to include letter C<','> in one of
I<sym>, write C<','>. For example,
C<-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=',,tmp'>
(note the single quote surrounding the option).


=item B<-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=>I<sym>B<,>I<sym>B<,...>


This is similar to C<-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as C<vectorE<lt>intE<gt> blah(const vectorE<lt>intE<gt> &)>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., C<_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the I<sym> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not
using universal character names.


=item B<-fstack-check>

Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.

You can additionally specify a string parameter: C<no> means no
checking, C<generic> means force the use of old-style checking,
C<specific> means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare B<-fstack-check>.

Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:


=over 4


=item 1.

Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they will always be
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.


=item 2.

Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.


=item 3.

Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, the performances of the code are hampered.

=back


Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
C<specific> if no target support has been added in the compiler.


=item B<-fstack-limit-register=>I<reg>


=item B<-fstack-limit-symbol=>I<sym>


=item B<-fno-stack-limit>

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address B<0x80000000>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
B<-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit> and
B<-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.


=item B<-fsplit-stack>

Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the i386 and x86_64 backends running
GNU/Linux.

When code compiled with B<-fsplit-stack> calls code compiled
without B<-fsplit-stack>, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with B<-fsplit-stack> is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without B<-fsplit-stack> always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21
and later.


=item B<-fleading-underscore>

This option and its counterpart, B<-fno-leading-underscore>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.

B<Warning:> the B<-fleading-underscore> switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.


=item B<-ftls-model=>I<model>

Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The I<model> argument should be one of C<global-dynamic>,
C<local-dynamic>, C<initial-exec> or C<local-exec>.

The default without B<-fpic> is C<initial-exec>; with
B<-fpic> the default is C<global-dynamic>.


=item B<-fvisibility=>I<default|internal|hidden|protected>

Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option---all
symbols will be marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is B<strongly> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.

Despite the nomenclature, C<default> always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
C<protected> and C<internal> are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option will be C<hidden>.
The default if B<-fvisibility> isn't specified is
C<default>, i.e., make every
symbol public---this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
GCC.

A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
symbols have the correct visibility is given by "How To Write
Shared Libraries" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
S<E<lt>B<http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/>>E<gt>)---however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLL's on Windows and with B<-fvisibility=hidden>
and C<__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))> instead of
C<__declspec(dllexport)> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.

For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
B<#pragma GCC visibility> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
B<#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)> and
B<#pragma GCC visibility pop>.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed B<as
part of the API interface contract> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should B<always> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection overheads---making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.

Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say B<#pragma GCC visibility push(default)>
before including any such headers.

B<extern> declarations are not affected by B<-fvisibility>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with B<-fvisibility=hidden> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to B<extern>
functions with no explicit visibility will use the PLT, so it is more
effective to use B<__attribute ((visibility))> and/or
B<#pragma GCC visibility> to tell the compiler which B<extern>
declarations should be treated as hidden.

Note that B<-fvisibility> does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that will
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the B<type_info> nodes will be unified between
the DSOs.

An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at E<lt>B<http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility>E<gt>.


=item B<-fstrict-volatile-bitfields>

This option should be used if accesses to volatile bitfields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag the user could
declare all peripheral bitfields as "unsigned short" (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16 bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32 bit access.

If this option is disabled, the compiler will use the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that will access bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bitfield, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.

If the target requires strict alignment, and honoring the field
type would require violating this alignment, a warning is issued.
If the field has C<packed> attribute, the access is done without
honoring the field type.  If the field doesn't have C<packed>
attribute, the access is done honoring the field type.  In both cases,
GCC assumes that the user knows something about the target hardware
that it is unaware of.

The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.


=back



=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.

Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
B<-B>, B<-I> and B<-L>.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC.



=over 4


=item B<LANG>


=item B<LC_CTYPE>


=item B<LC_MESSAGES>


=item B<LC_ALL>

These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information that allow GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
B<LC_CTYPE> and B<LC_MESSAGES> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is B<en_GB.UTF-8> for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.

The B<LC_CTYPE> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.

The B<LC_MESSAGES> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.

If the B<LC_ALL> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of B<LC_CTYPE> and B<LC_MESSAGES>; otherwise, B<LC_CTYPE>
and B<LC_MESSAGES> default to the value of the B<LANG>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.


=item B<TMPDIR>

If B<TMPDIR> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.


=item B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX>

If B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

If B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX> is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.

If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

The default value of B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX> is
F<I<prefix>/lib/gcc/> where I<prefix> is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases I<prefix> is the value
of C<prefix> when you ran the F<configure> script.

Other prefixes specified with B<-B> take precedence over this prefix.

This prefix is also used for finding files such as F<crt0.o> that are
used for linking.

In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with B</usr/local/lib/gcc>
(more precisely, with the value of B<GCC_INCLUDE_DIR>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with B<-Bfoo/>, GCC will search
F<foo/bar> where it would normally search F</usr/local/lib/bar>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next. If a standard directory begins with the configured
I<prefix> then the value of I<prefix> is replaced by
B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX> when looking for header files.


=item B<COMPILER_PATH>

The value of B<COMPILER_PATH> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like B<PATH>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX>.


=item B<LIBRARY_PATH>

The value of B<LIBRARY_PATH> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like B<PATH>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using B<GCC_EXEC_PREFIX>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the B<-l> option (but directories specified with
B<-L> come first).


=item B<LANG>

This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for B<LANG> are recognized:


=over 4


=item B<C-JIS>

Recognize JIS characters.

=item B<C-SJIS>

Recognize SJIS characters.

=item B<C-EUCJP>

Recognize EUCJP characters.

=back


If B<LANG> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.

=back


Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.





=over 4


=item B<CPATH>


=item B<C_INCLUDE_PATH>


=item B<CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH>


=item B<OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH>

Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like B<PATH>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, C<PATH_SEPARATOR>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.

B<CPATH> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with B<-I>, but after any paths given with B<-I>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.

The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with B<-isystem>, but after any
paths given with B<-isystem> options on the command line.

In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
B<CPATH> is C<:/special/include>, that has the same
effect as B<S<-I. -I/special/include>>.



=item B<DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT>

If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.

The value of B<DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
I<file>B< >I<target>, in which case the rules are written to
file I<file> using I<target> as the target name.

In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options B<-MM> and B<-MF>,
with an optional B<-MT> switch too.


=item B<SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES>

This variable is the same as B<DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
B<-M> rather than B<-MM>.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

=head1 FOOTNOTES

=item 1.

On some systems, B<gcc -shared>
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, B<gcc -shared> must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.
